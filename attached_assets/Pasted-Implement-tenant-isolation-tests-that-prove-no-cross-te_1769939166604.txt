Implement tenant isolation tests that prove no cross-tenant data leaks.

Context:
- Express backend + Postgres + Drizzle
- Tenant context exists (requireTenantContext middleware)
- We want 404 (preferred) for cross-tenant access to avoid tenant enumeration.

Goal:
Create a test suite that creates Tenant A and Tenant B, seeds tenant-owned records in both, then verifies:
- Tenant A list endpoints only return A records
- Tenant A cannot fetch/update/delete Tenant B record IDs (returns 404 or 403, prefer 404)
- Totals/pagination are tenant-scoped (no leaks via counts)

Implementation steps:

1) Create test utilities:
- createTenant() -> tenant record
- createUserAndLogin(tenant) -> returns auth cookies/headers used by supertest
- seedTenantData(tenant) -> creates one record per module (employees, attendance, leaves, projects, payroll-run if applicable)
- requestAs(auth) -> helper to call APIs with correct cookies/headers + tenant context

2) Create tests file:
server/__tests__/tenant-isolation.spec.ts

3) Choose representative tenant-owned endpoints (must exist and be stable):
- HRMS employees:
  - GET /api/hrms/employees
  - GET /api/hrms/employees/:id
  - PUT /api/hrms/employees/:id (or PATCH)
- HRMS attendance/leaves/projects:
  - GET list endpoints
  - GET by id if available
- Furniture module (if tenant-owned):
  - one list + one detail endpoint
- Services module (already had tests earlier; add one more if needed)

4) Test cases (minimum):
A) List isolation:
- As tenant A: list employees -> does NOT include tenant B record, and count/total does not include B.
B) Detail isolation:
- As tenant A: GET employee B by id -> 404 (or 403)
C) Mutation isolation:
- As tenant A: update employee B -> 404/403 and DB record unchanged
- As tenant A: delete employee B -> 404/403 and DB record still exists for tenant B
D) Pagination isolation:
- Seed 2 records in each tenant, confirm A totals == 2 only for A, not 4.

5) DB assertions:
- After mutation attempts, query DB directly using Drizzle to verify B record unchanged.

6) Standardize responses:
- If current handlers return 403 for cross-tenant: accept 403 temporarily but add TODO to convert to 404.
- Prefer 404 for “not found” to prevent enumeration.

Deliverables:
- tenant-isolation.spec.ts passing
- test utils for tenant/user/auth setup
- note in docs/route-coverage-checklist.md marking “Tenant isolation tests” as done
