The Platform Admin create form still shows “0 countries selected” even when IN/MY/GB chips are visible.
This confirms the selected countries UI is NOT bound to the react-hook-form field validated by Zod.

Do NOT change UI styling. Fix only form wiring, schema field name, and payload mapping.

1) Locate the create admin form:
- File likely: client/src/pages/admin/platform-admins.tsx (or similar)
- Identify:
  a) react-hook-form useForm() fields
  b) Zod schema field name for countries
  c) submit handler payload field name sent to backend

2) Make the country selector a controlled RHF field (MANDATORY)
- Replace any local state like selectedCountries/useState with RHF control.
- Use <Controller> to bind:
  name: "countryAssignments" (or the exact schema field)
  value: string[] (country codes like ["IN","MY"])
  onChange: updates the RHF field

Example requirement:
- Clicking IN toggles "IN" in the form field array.
- The UI chips/buttons must render directly from watch("countryAssignments").

3) Fix field name mismatch end-to-end
Pick ONE canonical field name and use it everywhere:
- Frontend form field
- Zod schema
- Backend request body
Recommended: countryAssignments: string[]

If backend expects allowedCountryIds, then map:
  countryAssignments -> allowedCountryIds
but do it explicitly in submit handler, and schema must validate whichever you use.

4) Fix type mismatch
- Ensure field is string[] only.
- No objects. No {label,value}. Only country codes/IDs.

5) Fix validation message logic
- Show “Select at least one country” ONLY when:
  role is PLATFORM_ADMIN/MANAGER/SUPPORT_TEAM AND countryAssignments.length === 0
- If countryAssignments.length > 0, hide the error.

6) Add a quick debug log (temporary during dev)
- On submit, console.log the payload being sent:
  { role, countryAssignments, ... }
- Confirm it contains ["IN","MY","GB"] when selected.

7) Tests
Add one test to prevent regression:
- Selecting IN sets form value length to 1 and allows submit (no validation error).

Deliverable:
- Selecting countries updates the validated RHF field
- Error disappears when countries are selected
- Submit succeeds and backend receives non-empty countryAssignments
