You are a senior full-stack architect and SaaS product engineer.

Build a production-ready, enterprise-grade, multi-tenant SaaS platform designed for small and medium businesses such as:
- PG / Hostels / Co-living
- Salons & Beauty Parlours
- Gyms & Fitness Centers
- Coaching / Training Institutes
- Service-based local businesses

The system must be scalable, modular, secure, and future-ready.

====================================
ARCHITECTURE & TECH STACK
====================================

• Backend: Node.js (NestJS preferred)
• Frontend: React (Admin & Staff Dashboard)
• Mobile: React Native (shared API)
• Database: PostgreSQL
• ORM: Prisma
• Auth: JWT + Refresh Tokens
• Cache: Redis
• Infrastructure: Docker-ready
• Cloud-ready for AWS (EC2, RDS, S3)
• API-first architecture

====================================
CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
====================================

1. Multi-tenant architecture with strict tenant isolation
2. Single codebase, multi-business support
3. Feature-based module enable/disable per tenant
4. Highly configurable (no hard-coded logic)
5. Minimal future refactoring
6. Enterprise-level validation & auditability

====================================
MANDATORY MODULES
====================================

1. Tenant Management
   - Tenant creation
   - Domain mapping (custom domain support)
   - Branding (logo, colors)
   - Feature toggles

2. Authentication & Authorization
   - Role-based access (Admin, Staff, Customer)
   - Permission matrix
   - Secure JWT handling
   - Session tracking

3. User & Staff Management
   - Roles & permissions
   - Activity logs
   - Staff skill mapping

4. Service & Booking Engine
   - Service catalog
   - Time-slot based booking
   - Resource allocation
   - Conflict detection

5. Billing & Payments
   - Invoices
   - Subscriptions
   - Payment status tracking
   - Razorpay-ready integration

6. Inventory (Optional per tenant)
   - Product catalog
   - Stock management
   - Alerts

7. Notifications
   - Email / SMS / WhatsApp
   - Template-based
   - Event-triggered

8. Reporting & Analytics
   - Revenue reports
   - Usage metrics
   - Exportable data

====================================
DATA & VALIDATION RULES
====================================

• All tables must include:
  - tenant_id
  - created_at
  - updated_at
• Soft deletes required
• Input validation using schema validators
• Centralized error handling
• Audit logs for critical actions

====================================
MULTI-TENANT ENFORCEMENT
====================================

- Every request must resolve tenant context
- Tenant data isolation enforced at DB & service level
- Middleware-based tenant validation
- Feature flags per tenant

====================================
DATABASE REQUIREMENTS
====================================

- Versioned migrations
- Seed data for demo tenants
- Strong relational integrity
- Optimized indexing

====================================
DEPLOYMENT & DEVOPS
====================================

- Dockerized services
- Environment-based configuration
- CI/CD friendly structure
- Auto-migration on deploy
- AWS-ready (EC2, RDS, S3, CloudWatch)

====================================
DELIVERABLES
====================================

1. Clean project structure
2. Well-documented APIs
3. Environment configuration samples
4. Database schema & migrations
5. Sample seed data
6. Scalable architecture

====================================
GOAL
====================================

Build a future-proof SaaS platform that:
- Supports multiple industries
- Scales horizontally
- Minimizes future rewrites
- Is enterprise ready
- Can evolve into a full SaaS ecosystem

Start by generating:
1. Folder structure
2. Database schema
3. Core authentication & tenant modules
