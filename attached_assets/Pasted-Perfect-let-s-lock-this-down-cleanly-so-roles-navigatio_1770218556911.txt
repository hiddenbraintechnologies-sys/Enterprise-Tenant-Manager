Perfect — let’s lock this down cleanly so roles, navigation, and naming all feel intentional (and you don’t get blank pages or confused users again).

I’ll break it into 3 crisp sections you can directly turn into specs.

1️⃣ Role → Settings Visibility Matrix (who sees what)
Roles assumed

Owner (tenant creator)

Admin (full ops, no billing ownership sometimes)

Manager (clinic/business manager)

Staff (front-desk, nurse, operator, etc.)

Accountant (optional, billing-only)

Settings access matrix
Settings Menu	Owner	Admin	Manager	Staff	Accountant
My Profile	✅	✅	✅	✅	✅
Organization Details	✅	✅	❌	❌	❌
Team & Roles	✅	✅	⚠️ View-only	❌	❌
Security & Access	✅	⚠️ Limited	❌	❌	❌
Plans & Billing	✅	⚠️ View-only	❌	❌	✅
Client Portal	✅	✅	⚠️ Limited	❌	❌
Branding & Templates	✅	✅	❌	❌	❌
Theme & Layout	✅	✅	✅	❌	❌
Notifications & Alerts	✅	✅	⚠️ Personal only	⚠️ Personal only	⚠️ Billing only
Important rules

❌ Never show disabled items → hide them entirely

⚠️ Limited = view or partial edit (safe fields only)

Staff should only see My Profile + personal notifications

This alone removes 80% of confusion.

2️⃣ Default Landing Page After Login (VERY IMPORTANT)
Golden rule

Never land users on a module page (/dashboard/service) directly after login or plan selection.

Universal landing logic (recommended)
Login → /dashboard (smart router)


Then decide internally 👇

Clinic Business (your focus)
Owner / Admin

👉 /dashboard/overview

Today’s appointments

Revenue snapshot

Alerts (subscription, setup incomplete)

Quick actions

Manager

👉 /dashboard/operations

Appointments

Patients

Staff availability

Staff

👉 /dashboard/my-work

Today’s tasks

Assigned appointments

Check-in / check-out

Non-clinic / Generic Business
Owner / Admin

👉 /dashboard/overview

Manager

👉 /dashboard/projects OR /dashboard/clients
(depends on business type)

Fallback safety rule (critical)

If:

user has no permission for preferred module

OR auth/session still loading

➡️ Redirect to /dashboard/overview, not a module page.

This prevents blank pages forever.

3️⃣ Naming Consistency Review (Dashboard + Sidebar)
Current problem (likely)

“Business” in settings

“Clients” in sidebar

“Service” route

“Customer Portal” elsewhere

This creates mental friction.

Recommended naming standard (pick ONE term and stick)
Core entities
Concept	Use this everywhere
Business / Tenant	Organization
Customer / Client	Client (shorter, B2B-friendly)
Service	Services (plural)
Staff	Team
Users	Team Members
Sidebar vs Settings alignment
Sidebar

Dashboard

Clients

Services

Appointments (clinic only)

Team

Reports

Settings

Organization Details

Team & Roles

Security & Access

Plans & Billing

👉 Same words, same meaning, zero confusion.

Route naming consistency (dev tip)

Avoid:

/dashboard/service ❌

/dashboard/settings/business ❌

Prefer:

/dashboard/services

/settings/organization

/settings/team

/settings/security

4️⃣ Final sanity checklist (QA + UX)

⛔ No role ever sees a page they can’t access

🔁 Login always lands on /dashboard, never deep routes

🧠 Sidebar + Settings use the same nouns

👀 If user lacks access → hide menu item (don’t disable)
