What’s missing now is bulk ergonomics + visual hierarchy. I’ll break this into clear, actionable fixes.

1️⃣ Missing: “Select All” + Bulk Actions (critical)
Problem

You can select individual employees

But:
❌ No Select all
❌ No Delete / Deactivate buttons
❌ Selected state feels incomplete

This makes bulk selection feel “half-implemented”.

✅ Recommended Zoho-style solution (works for cards)
A. Add a Select All checkbox in the toolbar

Place it left of “2 selected”:

☑ Select all   |  2 selected   [Deactivate] [Delete]   ✕ Clear

Behavior

Select all = selects current filtered list

If filter/search changes → selection resets

Checkbox states:

☐ none selected

☑ all selected

⧖ indeterminate (some selected)

B. Bulk action buttons (right side)
Button	Visible when	Enabled when
Deactivate	selection > 0	user has staff:update + addon active
Delete	selection > 0	admin role only
Clear	always	—

👉 Delete should be danger style

C. Exact shadcn Toolbar structure
<div className="flex items-center justify-between rounded-lg bg-muted px-4 py-2">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
    <Checkbox
      checked={isAllSelected}
      indeterminate={isPartialSelected}
      onCheckedChange={toggleSelectAll}
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      {selectedCount} selected
    </span>
  </div>

  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    {canDeactivate && (
      <Button variant="outline" onClick={bulkDeactivate}>
        Deactivate
      </Button>
    )}
    {canDelete && (
      <Button variant="destructive" onClick={bulkDelete}>
        Delete
      </Button>
    )}
    <Button variant="ghost" onClick={clearSelection}>
      ✕
    </Button>
  </div>
</div>


This is exactly how Zoho & FreshBooks do it.

2️⃣ Improve Employee Card UX (small but high impact)
Current issues

Cards are fine, but:

Too much equal visual weight

Status badge competes with name

Actions are invisible

✅ Recommended card improvements
A. Card click behavior

Click anywhere → Employee Details page

Checkbox click → selection only (stop propagation)

B. Visual hierarchy (very important)

Before

Name
Active
No designation
ID
Email
Phone
Date


After

Name                [Active]
Designation • ID
Email • Phone
Joined date


👉 Less vertical noise, more scannable.

C. Add quick-action menu (⋯) on hover

Top-right of card:

View

Edit

Deactivate / Reactivate

Delete (admin only)

Use shadcn DropdownMenu.

This solves:

“No edit option” complaint

Avoids cluttering the card

3️⃣ Select-state visual polish

You already have a red border 👍
Refine it slightly:

Selected card style
"border-primary ring-2 ring-primary/30 bg-primary/5"

Hover style (unselected)
"hover:border-muted-foreground/30 hover:shadow-sm"


Result:

Selected feels intentional

Hover feels interactive

4️⃣ Empty, loading, and edge states (enterprise polish)
A. No employees

Show:

Icon

“No employees yet”

Primary CTA: Add Employee

B. No results after search/filter

Show:

“No employees match your filters”

Secondary CTA: Clear filters

C. Mixed bulk delete result

Toast example:

1 employee deleted
1 skipped (has payroll history)

This reassures users.

5️⃣ Mobile improvements (very important)
Mobile rules

Cards become full-width

Checkbox moves to top-left overlay

Bulk action bar becomes sticky bottom sheet

[Deactivate]   [Delete]


Zoho does this very well.

6️⃣ Small UX bugs spotted in your screenshot 👀
Fix these:

Duplicate names (“Sricharan Bajanki” vs “SRI BAJANKI”) → normalize casing

Employee ID:

0001, 123123 → label it explicitly as Employee ID

Date format → respect tenant locale (MY → DD/MM/YYYY is fine)

7️⃣ Final “Zoho-grade” checklist for Employees page

✅ Select all
✅ Bulk deactivate/delete
✅ Hover actions
✅ Card click → details
✅ Clear hierarchy
✅ Mobile bulk actions
✅ Permission-aware buttons
✅ Add-on-aware actions

Once this is done, the page will feel complete and professional.
