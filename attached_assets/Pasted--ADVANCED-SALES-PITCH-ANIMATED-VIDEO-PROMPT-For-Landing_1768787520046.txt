🎬 ADVANCED SALES-PITCH ANIMATED VIDEO PROMPT

(For Landing Page + Customer Pitch)

🎯 OBJECTIVE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Create a 90–120 second animated explainer video that converts a small business owner who is:

Confused by too many tools

Afraid of complex software

Price-sensitive (India/MY/UK SMB mindset)

Wants clarity, not jargon

This video must make the customer think:

“This looks made for businesses like mine. I should try it.”

👤 TARGET PERSONA (Anchor your visuals to this)

PG / Hostel owner

Consultant / Software agency owner

Clinic admin

Small business with 3–20 staff

Uses Excel + WhatsApp + manual billing
