PHASE 2 GLOBAL PARITY & MATURITY FRAMEWORK

You are the Principal Architect & Auditor for a multi-tenant SaaS platform supporting multiple business modules (Furniture Manufacturing, Retail, Services, IT/HRMS, etc.).

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Create a Phase 2 execution plan to:

Ensure 100% feature parity across all business modules

Define global vs optional features (ALL features are GLOBAL)

Design a Module Maturity Score usable for sales, pricing, and roadmap tracking

Produce a Business + Tech Stack comprehensive document as source of truth

🧩 PART 1: GLOBAL FEATURE CANONICAL LIST (SOURCE OF TRUTH)

Audit the entire codebase and produce a canonical master feature registry that includes:

A. Core Platform (Mandatory for ALL modules)

Multi-tenant isolation

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Region & country availability control

Subscription & plan enforcement

Audit logs

Feature flags

Pagination on all list endpoints

Search, filter, export (CSV/PDF)

B. Financial & Commercial

Invoicing (draft → issued → paid → cancelled)

Tax engine (GST/VAT configurable)

Multi-currency support

Payment collection (transactional & idempotent)

Refunds & adjustments

Financial reports

C. Operations (Business-agnostic)

Inventory / resource tracking (where applicable)

Order / job lifecycle

Status transitions with validations

Attachments & document storage

Notes & activity timelines

D. HRMS (GLOBAL across ALL businesses)

Employee directory

Attendance

Leave management

Payroll

Departments & roles

HR analytics

E. Analytics & AI

Module analytics adapter

Cross-module dashboards

AI insights hooks (forecasting, alerts, summaries)

F. Notifications

Email

WhatsApp

In-app notifications

Event-based dispatch via BaseNotificationService

🚨 Rule:

If a feature exists in any module, it MUST exist in all modules (unless technically impossible, which must be documented).

🧩 PART 2: PHASE 2 PARITY ROLLOUT PLAN
(Module × Feature × Sprint Matrix)

Generate a table with:

Sprint	Module	Missing Feature	Source Module	Action	Owner	Risk

Rules:

Furniture + HRMS act as reference gold standards

Other modules must be upgraded to match them

Include backend + frontend + mobile parity

Identify shared services vs module adapters

Also output:

Sprint duration (2 weeks)

Dependencies

Regression checkpoints

🧩 PART 3: MODULE MATURITY SCORE (FOR SALES & PRICING)

Design a Module Maturity Score (0–100) based on:

Scoring Dimensions
Category	Weight
Feature Parity	30
Financial Completeness	20
HRMS Coverage	15
Analytics & AI	15
Mobile Readiness	10
Stability & Test Coverage	10
Output Per Module

Maturity Score

Tier mapping:

90–100 → Enterprise Ready

75–89 → Growth Ready

60–74 → SMB Ready

<60 → Beta

Use this score to:

Drive pricing tiers

Enable/disable sales eligibility

Prioritize roadmap investment

🧩 PART 4: BUSINESS + TECH STACK COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT

Generate a single authoritative document containing:

Business View

Supported industries

Global feature guarantees

Compliance readiness (SOC2, ISO future)

Pricing logic tied to maturity score

Technical View

Backend architecture

Base services (financial, notification, analytics)

Module adapter pattern

Database schema standards

API conventions

Mobile (Flutter) parity rules

Mark this document as:

“Source of Truth — Any deviation is a bug.”

🧩 PART 5: OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

Produce:

Feature Parity Audit Report

Phase 2 Sprint Plan (table)

Module Maturity Scoring Model

Business + Tech Stack Document

Actionable TODO list for Phase 2 execution

Be strict, opinionated, and production-grade.
Do not assume — verify from codebase.

🚀 SUCCESS CRITERIA

No module ships without global parity

Sales can price using maturity score

Engineering has zero ambiguity

Platform scales to 100+ industries without rewrites
