You are working on MyBizStream Super Admin panel.
Act as a senior full-stack engineer.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
1) Clicking "View Details" on a tenant navigates to 404
2) Super Admin cannot delete a tenant even after previous implementation

------------------------------------
PART 1: FIX "VIEW DETAILS" ROUTE (404)
------------------------------------

Frontend Fix:
- Ensure the action menu routes to:
  /super-admin/tenants/[tenantId]

Verify or create:
- File: app/super-admin/tenants/[tenantId]/page.tsx (Next.js)
  OR equivalent router file

Tenant Details Page must show:
- Tenant basic info (name, slug, business type)
- Country / region
- Subscription plan
- Status (ACTIVE / SUSPENDED / DELETED)
- Created date
- Primary owner
- Quick actions:
  - Suspend
  - Reactivate
  - Delete (Super Admin only)
  - Manage Users (navigate)

If route already exists:
- Fix param mismatch (id vs tenantId)
- Ensure router.push() uses correct param

------------------------------------
PART 2: BACKEND – TENANT FETCH API
------------------------------------

Ensure API exists:
GET /api/super-admin/tenants/:tenantId

Response:
{
  id,
  name,
  slug,
  businessType,
  country,
  region,
  status,
  plan,
  createdAt,
  owner
}

Return 404 only if tenant truly does not exist.

------------------------------------
PART 3: ENABLE DELETE TENANT (SOFT DELETE)
------------------------------------

Backend:
Ensure DELETE API exists:
DELETE /api/super-admin/tenants/:tenantId

Behavior:
- DO NOT hard delete
- Update tenant.status = "DELETED"
- Set deletedAt timestamp
- Invalidate sessions
- Log action in audit_logs

Authorization:
- Only SUPER_ADMIN allowed

------------------------------------
PART 4: FRONTEND – SHOW DELETE OPTION
------------------------------------

Update tenant action menu rules:

Show "Delete Tenant" if:
- role === SUPER_ADMIN
- tenant.status !== "DELETED"

On click:
- Show confirmation modal:
  "This will permanently disable the tenant. Data will be retained for audit."

On confirm:
- Call DELETE /api/super-admin/tenants/:tenantId
- On success:
  - Refresh tenant list
  - Show toast: "Tenant deleted successfully"

------------------------------------
PART 5: FIX STATUS ACTION LOGIC
------------------------------------

Action visibility rules:
- ACTIVE → Show Suspend, Delete
- SUSPENDED → Show Activate, Delete
- DELETED → No actions (read-only)

Ensure Cancel ≠ Delete
Cancel = subscription cancellation
Delete = tenant lifecycle removal

------------------------------------
PART 6: SAFETY & AUDIT
------------------------------------

- Log all tenant lifecycle actions:
  action_type: TENANT_SUSPENDED | TENANT_DELETED | TENANT_RESTORED
- Capture:
  - superAdminId
  - tenantId
  - timestamp
  - IP

------------------------------------
DELIVERABLES
------------------------------------

1) View Details page no longer returns 404
2) Tenant details page renders correctly
3) Delete Tenant visible & working
4) Status transitions enforced
5) No breaking changes

Proceed with fixes.
