Why it’s happening
1) Hardcoded UI strings

In client/src/pages/packages.tsx (and/or components/PlanCard.tsx), many strings are still like:

"Choose your plan"

"Start free and upgrade..."

"Monthly", "Yearly (save ...)",

"Get started with essential features", etc.

Those will never translate until you wrap them with t("...").

2) Plan names/descriptions coming from DB (English)

Your API plans likely return:

plan.name, plan.description

Those are currently saved in English, so even if i18n works, the UI will show English unless you:

store localized fields in DB (name_ms, name_ta, etc.), or

translate by tier code in frontend (free/basic/pro → t("plans.tiers.free.name") etc.)

For now, the easiest: translate by tier code.

Replit Prompt (copy/paste)

Use this exactly:

Fix Malaysia /packages translations fully (EN + MS + TA). Current issue: only chooseToGetStarted/selectFreeOrPaid translate, but the rest of the UI stays English because many strings are hardcoded or pulled from DB.

GOAL:
On /packages, when language is ms or ta, ALL visible UI strings must translate: page title, subtitle, billing cycle toggle labels, yearly savings label, recommended badge, plan tagline text, button labels, footer note, and “Free/Basic/Pro” labels if they’re shown as UI text.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1) Update client/src/pages/packages.tsx:
   - Replace ALL literal strings with i18n keys using useTranslation().
   - Keys needed include:
     packages.title
     packages.subtitle
     packages.trialNote (includes {{days}})
     packages.billing.monthly
     packages.billing.yearlyWithSave (includes {{saveAmount}})
     packages.recommendedBadge
     packages.cta.startFree
     packages.cta.getBasic
     packages.cta.getPro
     packages.footerNote (includes {{currency}} and tax note)
     packages.chooseToGetStarted
     packages.selectFreeOrPaid

2) Do NOT display plan.name / plan.description directly for the 3 standard tiers when country is MY.
   - Instead, map by plan.tier (free/basic/pro) to translated copy:
     plans.tiers.free.name / blurb
     plans.tiers.basic.name / blurb
     plans.tiers.pro.name / blurb
   - Keep backend plan.code/price/limits/features for calculations.

3) Update locale files:
   - client/src/i18n/locales/en.json
   - client/src/i18n/locales/ms.json
   - client/src/i18n/locales/ta.json
   Add all keys required above with correct translations.

4) Ensure “Yearly (save RM198)” is translated properly:
   - Use interpolation: t("packages.billing.yearlyWithSave", { saveAmount: formatPrice(save, currency) })
   - In Tamil and Malay, translate the structure, not just words.

5) Verify:
   - In /packages switch language to ms and ta
   - Confirm NO English hardcoded strings remain on the page (except dynamic business data).
   - Confirm no raw keys like “chooseToGetStarted” show.

Return a short summary + the list of files changed.

Files you should expect Replit to edit

These are the usual places:

client/src/pages/packages.tsx ✅ (main issue)

client/src/components/billing/PlanCard.tsx (or wherever the plan cards are rendered)

client/src/i18n/locales/en.json

client/src/i18n/locales/ms.json

client/src/i18n/locales/ta.json

If there’s also a /pricing page with same UI:

client/src/pages/pricing.tsx

After this fix, what will you see?

When language = Malay (ms) or Tamil (ta):

Monthly/Yearly toggle translates ✅

“Recommended” translates ✅

Card tagline (“Get started with essential…”) translates ✅

Buttons (“Start free / Get Basic / Get Pro”) translate ✅

No more raw keys like chooseToGetStarted ✅
