Remove “Replit” wording (neutral)

Replace any “managed through your Replit account” with:

Profile is managed through your account provider.
or (if you want it even simpler)

Profile is managed externally.

2) Tailwind spacing rules to tighten layout (clean + consistent)

Use these as your “design tokens”:

Page layout

Outer container: max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8

Vertical rhythm: space-y-6 (desktop) / space-y-4 (mobile)

Section card spacing

Card: rounded-2xl border bg-background

Card padding: p-4 sm:p-6

Card header spacing: space-y-1

Card title: text-lg font-semibold

Card description: text-sm text-muted-foreground

Form grid (Business)

Use a 2x2 grid on desktop, stack on mobile:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2">
  ...
</div>

Field spacing

Between label and input: space-y-2

Labels: text-sm font-medium

Helper text: text-xs text-muted-foreground

Reduce “big empty padding” feel

Avoid large py-10 blocks; keep py-6

Don’t nest too many space-y-8; use space-y-4/6

Primary action alignment

For settings forms:

Action row: flex items-center justify-end gap-2 pt-2

On mobile, make button full width:

w-full sm:w-auto

Optional “sticky save” (very SaaS):

<div className="sticky bottom-0 z-10 -mx-4 sm:mx-0 border-t bg-background/80 backdrop-blur px-4 py-3 sm:rounded-b-2xl">
  <div className="flex justify-end">
    <Button className="w-full sm:w-auto">Save</Button>
  </div>
</div>

3) Mobile layout rules (so it feels premium)
Rule A — no 2-column forms on small screens

Everything stacks to 1 column under sm

Inputs use w-full

Rule B — avoid long scroll with collapsible groups

On mobile, Settings home should be:

Profile summary (compact)

List of tiles (Business / Branding / Billing / Security / Appearance)
Each tile goes to its own page.

Rule C — sticky save on forms

On mobile, users hate scrolling back to find “Save”.
Make save bar sticky bottom (as above).

Rule D — upload blocks become stacked

Branding uploads should be:

Logo upload block

Favicon upload block

Preview collapses into an accordion or moves below

Example:

Desktop: upload left, preview right

Mobile: preview below, or hidden behind “Preview” accordion

Rule E — reduce top banners on mobile

Upsell banner should be:

hidden on mobile or collapsed by default

or moved to Billing/Add-ons page only

4) Compare with Zoho / FreshBooks / Stripe patterns (what to copy)
Stripe

Settings is a hub (short list)

Each item opens a dedicated page

Forms are tight: 1–2 cards max

Actions are always visible (sticky footer patterns)
Copy: hub + dedicated pages + tight cards

Zoho (Zoho Books/CRM)

Lots of settings, but left-side settings nav

Grouped sections with clear headers

Deep pages for each setting
Copy: grouped nav + sections, avoid long single-page scroll

FreshBooks

Simple settings hub

Focus on a small number of key business settings

Friendly copy and minimal clutter
Copy: minimalism + clear business-first labels

What your app should emulate (best mix)

Stripe’s “hub + dedicated pages”

Zoho’s grouping when you add many settings later

FreshBooks’ copy tone and simplicity

Quick “professional” checklist you can use

Settings home fits on one screen ✅

Each settings page has max 2 cards ✅

Save button always visible (sticky or near bottom) ✅

No upsell banner interrupting settings ✅

Mobile: stacked layout + sticky save ✅

Labels are consistent: “Time zone”, “Business name”, etc. ✅
