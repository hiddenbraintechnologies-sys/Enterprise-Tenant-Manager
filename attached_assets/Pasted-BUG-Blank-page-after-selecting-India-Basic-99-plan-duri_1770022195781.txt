BUG: Blank page after selecting India Basic ₹99 plan during signup.

Repro:
1) Register new tenant
2) Select Country = India, Business Type = Clinics
3) Go to Packages and click the ₹99 plan
4) App redirects to /dashboard/service and shows a completely blank page.

Goal:
- Identify root cause and fix redirect + guards so user always lands on a valid post-purchase screen (dashboard or onboarding completion), never a blank page.
- Ensure tenant context + subscription/entitlements are loaded before rendering dashboard routes.
- Add an error boundary + loading fallback so crashes never render blank.

Tasks:
A) Find the redirect code path after plan selection (client side). It likely calls navigate("/dashboard/service") or similar.
   - Change it to a safe route: "/dashboard" OR "/onboarding/complete" depending on your onboarding logic.
   - After successful plan selection, invalidate and refetch tenant/subscription/entitlements queries BEFORE navigating:
     - queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["tenant"] })
     - queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["subscription"] })
     - queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["entitlements"] })
     - await Promise.all([...refetches]) if you use refetchQueries

B) Add a hard guard in the /dashboard layout:
   - If tenant context is missing/loading, show a full-page loader (not null).
   - If tenant fetch fails, show an error screen with "Retry" and "Back to Packages".

C) Add an ErrorBoundary for all dashboard routes:
   - Wrap the dashboard route tree with an error boundary that shows an error card + retry.
   - Log the error to console for debugging.

D) Verify server response:
   - Confirm select-plan endpoint sets/returns enough info so frontend knows subscription is active.
   - If select-plan activates subscription asynchronously, add a small polling step (max 3 tries) to confirm subscription state before redirect.

Deliverables:
1) Explain root cause (console error + failing API call or missing route)
2) The exact files changed (client route/redirect + dashboard guard + error boundary)
3) Confirm fixed behavior:
   - After selecting ₹99 plan, user lands on dashboard (not /dashboard/service) with valid tenant context.
   - No blank page even if APIs fail.
