We need to make the FULL test suite pass. The Software Services & Consulting module is correct; failures are from pre-existing issues.

Do NOT refactor architecture. Do NOT change database schema unless absolutely required. Prefer compatibility fixes.

1) Fix signup API response contract
- Identify the signup endpoint response shape.
- Update it to include a stable structure that tests can rely on:
  return { data: { tenant: { id, ... }, user: { id, ... }, ... }, ... }
- Ensure backward compatibility: if clients already use the current shape, keep existing fields but ADD the missing nested fields (do not remove fields).
- Update any related typings.

2) Fix RBAC status mismatch (403 vs 401)
- Find the failing RBAC test.
- Ensure the endpoint returns:
  - 401 when not authenticated
  - 403 when authenticated but lacking permission
- Verify middleware order: auth must run before permission checks.
- Adjust the test only if it is clearly incorrect, otherwise fix the code behavior.

3) Fix TypeScript errors in server/routes.ts by aligning to actual interfaces/schema
- DatabaseStorage: add missing methods used by routes (getUser, updateUser) with correct implementations using existing DB access patterns.
- userTenants: remove/replace references to non-existent fields (e.g., createdAt) OR map to correct columns if they exist elsewhere.
- User fields: remove/replace isActive, loginAttempts, lastLoginAt references if not in schema; if the behavior is needed, implement safe fallbacks (e.g., treat missing as active; track attempts in a separate store only if already exists). Do NOT add new DB columns in this pass.
- Compliance service: add missing method stubs that routes call, returning safe defaults, unless the functionality already exists under another service name—then wire to the existing implementation.

4) Re-run tests
- After fixes, run the full test suite again.
- Provide a report: suites passed/failed, tests passed/failed, and list remaining failures with stack traces.

Success criteria:
- TypeScript build passes
- All test suites run (none blocked by TS)
- Signup contract tests pass (no undefined tenant.id)
- RBAC test returns correct status codes
