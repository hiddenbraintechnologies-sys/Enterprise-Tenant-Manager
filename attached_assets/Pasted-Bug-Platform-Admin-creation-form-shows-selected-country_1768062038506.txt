Bug: Platform Admin creation form shows selected country chips (e.g., IN/MY/GB) but still displays “0 countries selected” and blocks submit. This means the country picker UI state is not correctly bound to the form validation field.

Do NOT add features. Fix only the form wiring + validation messaging.

1) Identify the form stack
- Find the create admin form component and validation stack (react-hook-form + zod or equivalent).
- Identify the exact validated field name used for countries:
  e.g., allowedCountryIds OR countryAssignments OR assignedCountries.

2) Fix field name mismatch (most important)
- Ensure the country picker writes to the SAME field name that the Zod schema validates and the backend expects.
- If backend expects allowedCountryIds, then the form must submit { allowedCountryIds: ["IN","MY","GB"] }.

3) Fix controlled component binding
- Ensure the multi-select is controlled by the form, not separate local state.
- Use Controller (react-hook-form) or equivalent so:
  - onChange updates the form field
  - value is read from the form field
- Remove any duplicate local state unless it mirrors form value exactly.

4) Fix value type mismatch
- Ensure the form field stores string[] (country codes/IDs), not objects.
  Example:
    UI options: { label: "India", value: "IN" }
    Stored value: ["IN"]
- If currently storing objects, add a mapping layer:
  onChange(options) => setValue(field, options.map(o => o.value))

5) Fix role-switch clearing behavior
- If role is global (SUPER_ADMIN / TECH_SUPPORT_MANAGER), clear the countries field AND chips.
- If role is scoped (PLATFORM_ADMIN/MANAGER/SUPPORT_TEAM), do not clear selected countries unless user explicitly clears.
- Ensure UI chips always reflect the form value.

6) Fix error message logic
- Error should show ONLY when role requires scope AND countries length === 0.
- If countries length > 0, no “0 countries selected” message should show.

7) Backend confirmation (already exists, verify)
- If scoped role + empty countries:
  return 400 { code: "SCOPE_REQUIRED" }
- Ensure frontend displays SCOPE_REQUIRED inline under the country picker.

8) Add tests (UI/integration)
- Test: select countries then submit -> no validation error
- Test: no countries selected for PLATFORM_ADMIN -> shows correct message and backend returns 400 SCOPE_REQUIRED if forced

Output:
- Root cause found (field mismatch vs binding vs type)
- Files changed
- Before/after behavior description
- Tests passing
