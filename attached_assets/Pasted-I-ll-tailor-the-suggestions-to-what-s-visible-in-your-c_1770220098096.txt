I’ll tailor the suggestions to what’s visible in your current UI flow (Profile → Settings → sidebar you showed), not generic theory.

Below is a directly-applicable spec you can hand to dev/QA.

A) RBAC visibility — according to your current Settings menu
Your current menu (observed)

Profile

Business

Branding

Appearance

Notifications

Billing

Customer Portal

Security

Users & Roles

✅ Corrected visibility per role (hide, don’t disable)
Owner

Sees everything

Profile
Business
Users & Roles
Security
Billing
Customer Portal
Branding
Appearance
Notifications

Admin

Sees everything except ownership-level billing controls

Profile
Business
Users & Roles
Security (view-only)
Billing (view-only)
Customer Portal
Branding
Appearance
Notifications


❌ Cannot:

Change plan

Cancel subscription

Change payment method

Manager (Clinic Manager)
Profile
Appearance
Notifications
Customer Portal (limited)


❌ Must NOT see:

Business

Users & Roles

Security

Billing

Branding

👉 This matches real clinic operations (no financial or security power).

Staff (Front desk / Nurse)
Profile
Notifications


That’s it.
Anything more causes confusion and risk.

Accountant
Profile
Billing
Notifications (billing-only)


❌ No dashboard modules
❌ No users / security / branding

B) Smart default landing page — based on what your app actually has
❌ What’s happening now (problem)
After Pro plan → /dashboard/service


This:

requires module permission

requires user loaded

fails if auth is still resolving
→ blank screen

✅ Correct landing logic (exact)
Always land here first
/dashboard


Then internally redirect using role + business type.

Clinic Business
Role	Landing route
Owner	/dashboard/overview
Admin	/dashboard/overview
Manager	/dashboard/appointments
Staff	/dashboard/my-work

Never /dashboard/service as first page.

Non-clinic / generic business
Role	Landing route
Owner/Admin	/dashboard/overview
Manager	/dashboard/clients
Staff	/dashboard/my-work
🛑 Mandatory safety fallback

If:

user has no permission for computed route

or permissions not loaded yet

➡️ redirect to:

/dashboard/overview


This single rule prevents all blank dashboards.

C) Naming consistency — based on your UI text
Problems visible now

“Business” in Settings

“Dashboard” elsewhere

“Service” route singular

“Customer Portal” vs “Clients”

✅ Exact renames (minimal but powerful)
Settings
Current	Change to
Business	Organization
Users & Roles	Team & Roles
Customer Portal	Client Portal
Appearance	Theme & Layout
Branding	Branding & Templates
Dashboard / routes
Current	Change to
/dashboard/service	/dashboard/services
Service (menu)	Services
Customers (if exists)	Clients

👉 Same words everywhere = no confusion.

D) QA checklist — specific to your issue
Login / Plan selection

 After Pro plan → redirected to /dashboard (NOT module)

 Sidebar is visible immediately

 /api/auth/user returns 200 before dashboard render

Role checks (clinic)

 Staff cannot see Billing, Security, Business

 Manager cannot access Users & Roles via URL

 Admin sees Billing but cannot change plan

 Owner sees everything

Route protection

 Direct open /dashboard/service without permission → redirect to /dashboard/overview

 Unauthorized settings page → hidden from menu AND blocked by backend

Regression (your reported bug)

 Clinic user → Pro plan → Proceed
✅ lands on dashboard
✅ no blank page
✅ no 401 in console

E) One-line dev rule (write this in code comments)

No redirect after login, signup, or payment should ever point to a module route. Always redirect to /dashboard and let RBAC decide.
