1) Mobile UX acceptance checklist for QA (copy/paste)
A. Global layout

 No horizontal scroll on any page (test: swipe left/right on every main page)

 Safe-area padding works on iOS (no content under notch/home bar)

 Text wraps correctly (no clipped headings, no “…” cutting important info)

 Tap targets ≥ 44px (buttons, icons, menu items, checkboxes)

 Keyboard doesn’t cover inputs (especially last fields + submit)

B. Navigation

 Mobile menu opens/closes reliably (hamburger/drawer)

 Active route highlight works after navigation

 Back button doesn’t break state or show blank screens

 No “hover-only” actions (all actions accessible by tap)

 Sidebar doesn’t disappear after clicking menu item (regression test)

C. Auth & onboarding

 Country selector modal works on mobile (scroll, close, select)

 Register form scrolls and submits (button always reachable)

 Login works after clearing cache (tenant discovery + tenant picker)

 Packages/plans page cards stack and CTA buttons are visible

 Redirects correct: register → packages → dashboard

D. Core tenant workflows

 Create/edit entity works on mobile for each enabled business module

 Marketplace: Add-on install/trial shows clear state (no infinite spinner)

 Marketplace purchase errors show readable message + retry

 HR Foundation/HRMS/Payroll gating behaves correctly on mobile:

 Payroll only → Employees visible, HRMS suite hidden

 HRMS only → HRMS suite visible, Payroll hidden

 Both → both visible

 Employee limit errors show clearly (EMPLOYEE_LIMIT_REACHED)

E. Forms & validation

 Required field errors appear inline near fields

 Submit button disabled only when appropriate (not stuck)

 Form works in narrow view (320px) and standard (375–414px)

 Dropdowns usable (no clipped menus off-screen)

 Date/time pickers usable (mobile-friendly)

F. Tables & lists

 All tables have a mobile layout (cards or horizontal scroll)

 Actions (edit/delete/view) are reachable without hover

 Pagination controls usable on mobile (tap targets, spacing)

 Empty states are readable and not broken

G. Modals & dialogs

 Modal never renders off-screen

 Modal scrolls internally if content tall

 Close button always reachable

 Confirm actions require explicit confirmation (delete/wipe)

H. Performance & stability

 No page takes >3–4s without showing skeleton/loading state (on mobile network throttling)

 No permanent spinners

 No repeated refetch loops when opening modals

 No console errors on common flows

I. Super Admin (mobile)

 Super-admin menu usable on mobile (drawer)

 Marketplace Catalog and Country Rollouts usable (card layout)

 Tenant details view usable + no 404 on “view details”

 Delete/Wipe modals usable on mobile

J. Accessibility basics

 Focus visible on keyboard navigation

 Form labels accessible (screen readers)

 Color contrast acceptable for key text

2) Mobile-first component patterns (tables, cards, modals)
A) Tables → “Responsive DataList” pattern (recommended)

Desktop: normal table
Mobile: card list where each row becomes a card with label/value pairs + actions

Rules

Card header: primary identifier + status badge

Body: 3–6 key fields (label/value)

Footer: primary action + overflow menu (⋯)

Avoid showing 10+ fields; link to details page for full view

Example structure

Card header: Customer Name + Status

Card body: Amount, Date, Owner

Card footer: View button + ⋯ menu (Edit/Delete)

Implementation note

Use the same data source and map to either <Table/> or <CardList/> by breakpoint.

Keep sorting/filtering same; only layout changes.

B) Cards → “Action-first cards”

Rule: Every card must have a clear action, not hidden hover buttons.

Primary CTA visible (“Create”, “View”, “Pay”, “Install”)

Secondary actions under a kebab menu

Status and warnings near top (not bottom)

Best layout

Title (1 line)

Micro-benefit or key stat (1–2 lines)

CTA row (buttons full-width on mobile)

Optional details collapsed behind “Show details”

C) Modals → “Bottom Sheet on Mobile, Dialog on Desktop”

Why: mobile dialogs often render off-screen; bottom sheets feel native.

Rules

On mobile, modal opens as a bottom sheet:

90% height max

Internal scroll

Sticky action bar at bottom (Cancel/Confirm)

On desktop, normal centered dialog

Must-have

Close icon top-right

Title always visible

Submit buttons always visible (sticky bottom)

If form is long: split into steps (“Next”)

D) Forms → “Sticky submit + safe keyboard”

Sticky footer button on mobile

Scroll to first error on submit

Use input types properly (email, tel, number)

Avoid multi-column forms on mobile

3) PWA readiness suggestions (offline, install banner, icons)
A) Minimum PWA checklist (should do)

Web App Manifest

name, short_name

icons (192, 512, maskable 512)

theme_color, background_color

display: standalone

start_url: /

Service Worker (Workbox recommended)

Cache static assets (JS/CSS/fonts/icons)

Network-first for API calls

Offline fallback page for navigation routes

B) Offline strategy (practical for SaaS)

You typically don’t want full offline CRUD for multi-tenant SaaS initially. Do this instead:

Offline read-only shell

App loads with cached shell UI

Show banner: “You’re offline. Some actions are unavailable.”

Queue-only for safe actions (optional later)

Allow drafting forms locally, submit when back online

Only for non-financial actions (notes, drafts)

Rules

Payments, admin actions, and billing should be blocked offline.

Show clear “Retry when online” state.

C) Install banner behavior

Don’t auto-spam.

Show “Install App” prompt when:

user has logged in

visited ≥ 2 times

not dismissed in last 14 days

Provide manual install button in user menu too.

D) Icons & splash

Add maskable icons (Android)

Add apple-touch-icon (iOS)

Provide splash-ready background color (manifest + CSS)

E) Caching precautions

Never cache authenticated API responses blindly.

Use:

Cache-Control: no-store for sensitive endpoints

SW should avoid caching /api/* unless explicitly safe (like /api/public/rollouts)
