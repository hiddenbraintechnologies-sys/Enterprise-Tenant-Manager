Add HRMS Module (Cross-Business, IT-Ready)

Objective
Implement a multi-tenant, cross-business HRMS module that works for all industries (Furniture, PG/Hostel, Retail, Services, etc.) and includes IT-industry–specific capabilities, while remaining modular and reusable.

This module must integrate cleanly with existing RBAC, tenant isolation, audit logging, notifications, and analytics base services.
