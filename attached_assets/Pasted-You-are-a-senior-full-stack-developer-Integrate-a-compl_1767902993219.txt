You are a senior full-stack developer. Integrate a complete HRMS module into an existing multi-tenant SaaS platform called MyBizStream. The platform has Furniture as baseline with fully abstracted services: BaseFinancialService, BaseNotificationService, BaseAnalyticsAdapter, tenantIsolationMiddleware(), requireMinimumRole(), auditService, and Flutter mobile app structure.

Requirements:

1. Backend Routes (server/routes/hrms/):
   - Endpoints: dashboard, employees, attendance, leave, leave-types, payroll.
   - Features:
     - Tenant isolation (tenantIsolationMiddleware)
     - RBAC (requireMinimumRole)
     - Audit logging (auditService)
     - Notification dispatch (BaseNotificationService) for onboarding, leave requests, approvals, payroll.
     - Pagination and filtering for employee directory, attendance, payroll.
   - Use existing database schemas: employees, departments, attendance, leaves, leave_types, payroll.

2. Flutter Mobile (mobile/lib/features/hrms/):
   - Pages:
     - HR Dashboard: workforce stats, recent employees, pending leaves.
     - Employee Directory: search, filter, pagination, add/edit/delete.
     - Add/Edit Employee: full form, validation, dynamic departments.
     - Attendance: check-in/out, date navigation, summary stats.
     - Leave Management: apply/approve/reject, status tabs/filters.
     - Payroll: month selector, run payroll, status filters.
   - BLoCs: HrDashboardBloc, EmployeeBloc, AttendanceBloc, LeaveBloc, PayrollBloc.
   - Repository: HrRepository for all API calls.
   - Integrate notifications via BaseNotificationService.

3. Analytics:
   - Add workforce metrics to BaseAnalyticsAdapter (optional).

4. Testing & Validation:
   - Ensure tenant isolation, RBAC, audit logging, pagination are enforced.
   - Provide mock data for employees, leaves, attendance, payroll for testing.
   - Include basic CRUD and workflow tests.

5. Output Format:
   - Provide full backend route code with file paths.
   - Provide Flutter pages, BLoCs, and repository code with file paths.
   - Include wiring for notifications and analytics.
   - Include comments for developers for clarity.
   - Ready-to-merge into MyBizStream Phase 2.

Generate the full integration code for HRMS module in one output.
