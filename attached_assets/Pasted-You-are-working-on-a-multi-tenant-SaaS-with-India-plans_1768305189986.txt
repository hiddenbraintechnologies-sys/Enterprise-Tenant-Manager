You are working on a multi-tenant SaaS with India plans (Free ₹0, Basic ₹99, Pro ₹199). Currently Monthly/Yearly toggle only changes the label; the price stays the same. Fix this properly by introducing real billing intervals with different prices, and allow Super Admin to configure both.

GOAL
- Monthly and Yearly must have different prices.
- Switching toggle must change pricing values dynamically.
- Works for all business categories (not hardcoded).
- Super Admin can set monthly + yearly prices (or yearly discount) per plan.
- Tenant subscription stores interval (MONTHLY/YEARLY).
- Downgrades apply only at period end (already decided).

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS
1) Database
- Add support for interval-specific plan pricing.
- Preferred design:
  - pricing_plans table stays (code, name, countryCode, tier, featureFlags, limits, isRecommended, archivedAt)
  - NEW pricing_plan_prices table:
    - id, planId (FK), billingInterval ENUM('MONTHLY','YEARLY'),
    - amount INTEGER (minor units or rupees as you already do),
    - currencyCode TEXT,
    - optional discountPercent INTEGER NULL,
    - createdAt/updatedAt
  - Unique constraint: (planId, billingInterval)
- Add migration.

2) Seed
- Seed BOTH MONTHLY and YEARLY prices for India:
  - india_free: 0 monthly + 0 yearly
  - india_basic: 99 monthly + 999 yearly (or use discountPercent 15–20)
  - india_pro: 199 monthly + 1999 yearly
- Keep idempotent seed behavior.

3) API
- Update GET /api/billing/plans to accept query params:
  - country (existing)
  - interval=MONTHLY|YEARLY (new, default MONTHLY)
- Response should include:
  - plan info + price for that interval (amount, currencyCode, interval)
- Ensure tenant isolation and RBAC remain unchanged.

4) Admin API
- Update create/update plan endpoints to accept both monthlyPrice and yearlyPrice (or discount).
- Persist in pricing_plan_prices.

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS
5) Packages page (/packages)
- Add/keep Monthly/Yearly toggle.
- Store billingInterval state.
- When user toggles, refetch plans from /api/billing/plans?country=IN&interval=<state>.
- Display the returned amount; do NOT just change the label.
- Ensure Free shows "Free" not ₹0.
- Buttons:
  - Monthly: “Get Basic (₹99/mo)”
  - Yearly: “Get Basic (₹999/yr) Save X%”
- Add a small “Save X%” badge for yearly if discount exists.

6) Pricing page (/in pricing)
- Same logic as /packages.

7) Admin Billing > Pricing Plans
- Add UI to edit monthly + yearly pricing for each plan.
- Add validation:
  - India currency must be INR for both.
  - Yearly price must be <= monthly*12 (unless explicitly allowed).
- Show computed savings.

TESTS
8) Add/Update tests:
- Plans endpoint returns correct price for requested interval.
- Toggle changes pricing values.
- Seed creates two prices per plan.
- Admin updates both prices.

DELIVERABLE
- Provide the exact files changed with a short summary.
- Ensure TypeScript builds and tests pass.
