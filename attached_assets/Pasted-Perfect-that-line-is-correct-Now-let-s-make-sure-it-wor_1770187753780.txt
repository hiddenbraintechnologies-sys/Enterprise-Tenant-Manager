Perfect 👍 — that line is correct.
Now let’s make sure it works reliably in Replit + CI, and doesn’t bite you later.

1) Final package.json snippet (recommended)

Put it under scripts:

{
  "scripts": {
    "lint:terminology": "bash scripts/no-clinic-terms-core.sh",
    "lint": "npm run lint:terminology",
    "pretest": "npm run lint:terminology"
  }
}


Why:

lint:terminology → manual/local use

lint → easy CI hook

pretest → blocks tests if forbidden terms exist

2) Make sure the script actually runs (common pitfalls)
A) Ensure executable permission (important)

Run once:

chmod +x scripts/no-clinic-terms-core.sh


If you skip this, CI may fail with:

permission denied

B) Ensure bash exists (Replit-safe)

Replit Linux environments do have bash, so you’re safe.

If you ever move to a Windows-only runner, see section 5.

3) Expected behavior (what “success” looks like)
When clean
npm run lint:terminology


Output:

Scanning for clinic-specific terms in non-clinic UI...
✅ No forbidden clinic terms found in core UI.


Exit code: 0 ✅

When someone reintroduces bad copy

Example:
"Display Name (shown to patients)"

CI output:

❌ Forbidden clinic terms found outside clinic module:
client/src/components/AddUserModal.tsx:42: Display Name (shown to patients)


Exit code: 1 ❌
→ build fails (as intended)

4) Allowlisting clinic-only modules (important)

You already did the right thing by excluding clinic paths:

"client/src/modules/clinic"
"server/modules/clinic"


Rule:

Clinic module may use patient/doctor

Everywhere else is forbidden

This enforces your global terminology standard automatically.

5) Optional: Node-based fallback (future-proof)

If you ever want cross-platform support (Windows CI), replace the bash script with Node.

Tell me if you want this and I’ll give you:

"lint:terminology": "node scripts/no-clinic-terms-core.js"


But for now — bash is perfectly fine.

6) Final verdict

✅ Script name correct
✅ Command correct
✅ CI-safe
✅ Enforces terminology discipline
✅ Prevents regression permanently

This is exactly the kind of guardrail mature SaaS products use.
