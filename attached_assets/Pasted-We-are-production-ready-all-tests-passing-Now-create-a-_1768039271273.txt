We are production-ready (all tests passing). Now create a PRODUCTION LAUNCH RUNBOOK and implement the final “launch hardening” tasks. Do NOT add new features. Do NOT refactor architecture. Only production readiness work.

1) Production Configuration & Safety
- Ensure dev-only endpoints (seed/demo) are DISABLED in production (hard environment guard).
- Add a “startup config validation” that checks required env vars exist:
  DATABASE_URL, JWT secrets, OIDC/Replit auth config, WhatsApp/email provider keys (if enabled), base URLs.
- If any required env var is missing, log a clear error and run in “degraded mode” (only /health works), returning 503 DB_UNAVAILABLE or CONFIG_INVALID for other routes.

2) Health, Monitoring, and Observability
- Confirm /health and /health/db are stable and fast.
- Add an optional /health/ready endpoint that checks:
  - DB reachable (SELECT 1)
  - migrations status (if applicable)
  - essential services configured
- Add structured logging for:
  - auth failures
  - tenant isolation blocks (404)
  - config errors
  - DB connection failures
- Add basic error tracking hook (Sentry-compatible) behind an env flag, no hard dependency.

3) Database & Migrations
- Ensure migrations are explicit and safe:
  - Provide a single command/script: “npm run migrate:deploy” (or equivalent)
  - Ensure it is idempotent and fails loudly on errors
- Add a “migration status” check used by /health/ready.

4) Security & Rate Limits
- Confirm rate limits for login/auth endpoints are enabled in production.
- Ensure CORS config is correct for production domains.
- Ensure cookies/session/JWT settings are secure in prod (httpOnly, secure, sameSite where relevant).
- Confirm no secrets are logged anywhere.

5) Release Smoke Test Script
Create a script “scripts/smoke-prod-check.ts” (or .sh) that:
- Calls /health, /health/db, /health/ready
- Logs in (or uses test token) and hits one endpoint per module:
  - Furniture: list products, create sales order (dry-run if possible), generate invoice PDF endpoint
  - Services: list projects, create project, create timesheet
- Verifies tenant isolation by attempting cross-tenant access (expects 404)
- Prints PASS/FAIL summary and exits non-zero on failure

6) Documentation
Generate a “PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md” that includes:
- Required env vars list + examples (no real secrets)
- Deployment steps (Replit prod + AWS + GCP high-level)
- How to run migrations
- How to run smoke tests
- Rollback plan
- Monitoring checklist (what endpoints to monitor, alert thresholds)
- Incident checklist (DB down, auth down, WhatsApp down)

Deliverables:
- PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md
- scripts/smoke-prod-check.*
- Any minimal code changes needed to enforce the above (guards/logging/health readiness)
- Confirm all tests still pass after changes
