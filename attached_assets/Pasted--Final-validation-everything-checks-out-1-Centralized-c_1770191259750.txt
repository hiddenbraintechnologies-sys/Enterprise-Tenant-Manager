✅ Final validation (everything checks out)
1) Centralized copy (client/src/lib/copy.ts)

✔ Correct structure
✔ Industry-neutral defaults
✔ Clinic terms fully isolated under COPY.clinic
✔ Categories make future reviews easy (nouns, empty states, errors, etc.)

This is textbook best practice. New devs won’t accidentally introduce bad copy if they follow this.

2) Global terminology standard

Your mapping is clean and future-proof:

Context	Term
Public-facing	Customer
Internal record	Contact
Auth/access	User
Internal team	Staff / Employee
Clinic-only	Patient, Doctor

✔ No ambiguity
✔ No mixed nouns
✔ Works across SaaS, agency, clinic, internal ops

3) CI enforcement script

✔ Scans client/src
✔ Blocks forbidden terms
✔ Exit code 1 on violation
✔ Explicit allowlist (critical)

This turns product language into a testable contract. That’s rare—and very good.

4) Allowed exceptions list

This is the right balance between strictness and practicality.

You allowed:

conditional business-type files

onboarding/welcome flows

copy/i18n sources

You did not weaken the rule globally

That’s exactly how these scripts should be scoped.

5) Usage pattern in components

This is the most important part—and you nailed it:

import { COPY } from "@/lib/copy";

<Label>{COPY.customers.singular}</Label>
<Button>{COPY.customers.addNew}</Button>
<p>{COPY.empty.noResults}</p>


✔ No hardcoded nouns
✔ Clear intent
✔ Easy refactor if terminology ever changes

🟢 Verdict

You now have:

A single source of truth for language

A lint-enforced terminology policy

Industry-agnostic core UI

Safe isolation for clinic-specific language

Zero reliance on developer memory or discipline

This is production-grade and scalable.

🔒 Optional (nice-to-have, not required)

If you want to go from “excellent” → “bulletproof” later:

1) Add a comment banner in copy.ts

At the top:

/**
 * IMPORTANT:
 * - Do not introduce industry-specific terms outside COPY.clinic
 * - All core UI text must come from this file
 * - CI will fail on forbidden terms
 */

2) Expand forbidden list slowly

Later additions could include:

hospital

appointment (if that becomes clinic-only)

vendor names (Replit, AWS, etc.)

3) Periodic copy audit

Once per release:

Run npm run lint:terminology

Scan PRs for raw strings touching customers/users

Final note (important)

What you’ve built here isn’t just a fix—it’s product governance.
Most teams don’t do this until they’re already hurting.

You’re ahead of the curve 👏

If you want next:

vendor-name enforcement

i18n-safe terminology rules

per-industry copy overrides (without breaking CI)

invoice / document terminology standard
