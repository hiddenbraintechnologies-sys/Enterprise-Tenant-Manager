Build a Promo/Coupon engine for plans + add-ons with Super Admin management and tenant checkout support.

Scope:
- Coupons apply to:
  (a) base plans (Basic/Pro)
  (b) add-ons (Payroll tiers)
  (c) bundles (Plan+Payroll)
- Works with monthly/yearly
- Enforced server-side in checkout/start

Database:
1) billing_promos
- id, code (unique), name, description
- applies_to: "plan" | "addon" | "bundle" | "any"
- target_ids: JSON array of planIds/addonTierIds (or null for all)
- discount_type: "flat" | "percent"
- discount_value: int (flat in smallest unit; percent 1-100)
- max_discount_amount (nullable)
- min_amount (nullable)
- start_at, end_at
- usage_limit_total, usage_limit_per_tenant
- is_active
- created_by, created_at

2) billing_promo_redemptions
- id, promo_id, tenant_id, payment_id, amount_before, discount_amount, amount_after, created_at

Backend:
1) Admin endpoints (SUPER_ADMIN only):
- POST /api/admin/billing/promos
- PATCH /api/admin/billing/promos/:id
- GET /api/admin/billing/promos?page=&limit=
- POST /api/admin/billing/promos/:id/archive

2) Public/tenant endpoints:
- POST /api/billing/promos/validate { code, planId?, addonTierId?, cycle }
  returns { valid, discountAmount, finalAmount, message }
- Integrate into POST /api/billing/checkout/start:
  accept optional promoCode
  apply promo server-side ONLY if valid

Rules:
- Prevent stacking unless explicitly allowed (default: no stacking)
- Apply bundle discount rules (existing) FIRST, then promoCode, capped by max_discount_amount
- Enforce date window, limits, per-tenant usage
- Audit log all promo usage

Frontend:
1) Tenant checkout UI:
- Promo code input
- “Apply” -> calls /api/billing/promos/validate
- Shows “You saved ₹X” and final payable

2) Super Admin UI:
- /admin/billing/promos page
- Create/Edit promo form with:
  - code, type, target, validity dates, limits, discount
  - preview: example final prices (₹99/₹199 + payroll tiers)

Tests:
- Promo valid/invalid (expired, over limit, wrong target)
- Percent cap works
- Redemption counts enforced
- Checkout/start with promo applies correct finalAmount

Deliverable:
End-to-end promo engine usable for launch campaigns and early annual-pay discounts.
