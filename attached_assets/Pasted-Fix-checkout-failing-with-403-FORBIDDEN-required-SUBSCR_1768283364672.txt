Fix checkout failing with 403 FORBIDDEN required="SUBSCRIBE" when simulating successful payment (paid plans).

Symptom:
On /checkout, clicking "Simulate Successful Payment" returns:
403 { message:"Insufficient permissions", code:"FORBIDDEN", required:"SUBSCRIBE" }
Subscription does not activate.

Goal:
Tenant owners/admins must be able to complete checkout and activate subscription after payment success (including dev simulation).
Free plan should work without payment.

Tasks:

1) Locate the endpoint called by "Simulate Successful Payment"
- Find client checkout handler (simulate success button) and identify the API path (e.g., POST /api/billing/payments/:id/simulate-success OR /api/billing/checkout/confirm).
- Confirm which backend route throws required="SUBSCRIBE".

2) Fix RBAC permission mapping for tenant roles
- In shared/rbac/permissions.ts (or equivalent), ensure:
  TENANT_OWNER includes "SUBSCRIBE"
  TENANT_ADMIN includes "SUBSCRIBE" (if you allow admins to manage billing)
- If you already have "SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGE", you may replace required permission in billing routes from "SUBSCRIBE" -> "SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGE" to reuse existing matrix.

3) Ensure guard checks tenant RBAC (not platform RBAC)
- The permission check must evaluate req.context.role (tenant role) when in tenant routes.
- If req.platformAdminContext exists, do not accidentally treat it as the user context for tenant billing flows.
- Add a unit test: tenant owner can call checkout confirm endpoint.

4) Ensure tenant context is sent on checkout requests
- All billing/checkout API calls must include X-Tenant-ID header or tenantId derived from session/JWT.
- If checkout is accessed before tenant is set, redirect user to tenant selection or auto-set default tenant immediately after signup.
- Add server-side fallback: if X-Tenant-ID missing but user has exactly one tenant, use it.

5) Validate onboarding flow permissions
- New tenant signup should create tenant + userTenant OWNER mapping before redirecting to /packages and /checkout.
- Confirm subscription endpoints run after tenant association exists.

6) Tests (must pass)
- New signup -> select BASIC -> checkout simulate success -> subscription becomes active and redirects to dashboard (200)
- Endpoint returns 401 only when unauthenticated
- Endpoint returns 403 only when user is staff role without billing privileges

Acceptance:
- Paid plan checkout simulation succeeds for tenant owner/admin
- No more 403 required SUBSCRIBE during normal tenant onboarding
