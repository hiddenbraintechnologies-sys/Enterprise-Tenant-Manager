Integrate UpgradeConfirmModal into client/src/pages/packages.tsx so upgrades show a confirmation before proceeding to payment.

Current:
Upgrade button triggers upgrade flow and navigates directly to /checkout.

Target behavior:
1) When tenant admin clicks Upgrade on a paid plan (Basic/Pro):
   - Open UpgradeConfirmModal
   - Modal shows:
     - priceLabel (formatPriceOrFree(plan.basePrice, plan.currencyCode))
     - “What you’ll get” list (newBenefits)
     - bilingual (lang="en"/"hi")
   - If user confirms:
     - proceed with existing upgrade API call
     - then navigate to checkout using returned redirectUrl/paymentId
   - If user cancels:
     - do nothing

2) For FREE plan selection:
   - Keep existing behavior (no payment modal) OR show a simple confirm (optional)
   - Do NOT block onboarding.

Implementation steps:
A) Add local state in packages.tsx:
   - upgradeModalOpen boolean
   - selectedTargetPlan object (plan)
   - computed priceLabel string
   - computed newBenefits array
   - onProceedToPay handler

B) Build newBenefits from FEATURE_CATALOG:
   - Show features that are enabled in target but not enabled in current:
     target.featureFlags[key] === true && current.featureFlags[key] !== true
   - Map to { label, description } using FEATURE_CATALOG.
   - Also include 1–2 limit improvements if helpful:
     (e.g., Users 1→3, Records 50→500, WhatsApp enabled)
   - Keep list short (max 5 items) to avoid clutter.

C) Render <UpgradeConfirmModal />
   - open={upgradeModalOpen}
   - lang={lang ?? "en"}
   - currentPlan, targetPlan
   - priceLabel
   - newBenefits
   - onProceedToPay:
       close modal
       call existing upgrade flow (POST /api/billing/subscription/change action="upgrade")
       handle response:
         if requiresPayment -> navigate to /checkout?paymentId=...
         else redirect to dashboard (should not happen for paid plans)
   - onCancel: close modal

D) Guardrails:
   - Only show upgrade modal for paid plans (basePrice > 0 or tier != FREE)
   - If subscription.status is pending_payment:
     don’t open upgrade modal; show “Continue to payment” banner instead.
   - Ensure permission check (SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGE) remains enforced; modal only appears if user can upgrade.

E) Add a couple UI tests (optional):
   - Clicking Upgrade opens modal
   - Confirm calls upgrade handler and navigates to checkout

Acceptance:
- Upgrading to BASIC/PRO shows UpgradeConfirmModal first
- Modal is bilingual and shows value (benefits)
- Confirm continues to checkout; cancel stays on /packages
- No regression to downgrade flow
