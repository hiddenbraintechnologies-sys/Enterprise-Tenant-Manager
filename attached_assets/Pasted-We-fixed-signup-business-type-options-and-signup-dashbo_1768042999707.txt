We fixed signup business type options and signup→dashboard routing, but Software Services/Consulting dashboards are still linking to HR module pages, which is not correct for these business types and may break workflows.

Do NOT add new features. Only fix routing/navigation and verify workflows.

1) Correct Dashboard Information Architecture
For SOFTWARE_SERVICES and CONSULTING, ensure the primary nav + quick actions point to:
- Projects (list + create)
- Tasks (by project, if available; otherwise hide)
- Timesheets (my timesheets + team timesheets if permitted)
- Invoices (reuse existing invoice module list)
- Customers/Clients (reuse CRM customers list)

Explicitly DO NOT link core dashboard actions to HRMS pages unless a feature flag enables HRMS for that tenant.

2) Verify Pages Actually Exist
Confirm these routes exist and render without 404:
- /dashboard/software-services
- /dashboard/software-services/projects
- /dashboard/software-services/timesheets
- /dashboard/software-services/invoices
- /dashboard/consulting
- /dashboard/consulting/projects
- /dashboard/consulting/timesheets
- /dashboard/consulting/invoices

If the app uses shared pages (e.g., /projects), ensure the links resolve correctly and the layout is consistent.

3) Feature Flag Gating
If HRMS exists as a separate module:
- Add gating so HRMS nav items show only when FEATURE_HRMS (or equivalent) is enabled.
- Software/Consulting tenants should not see HRMS by default.

4) Fix Any Broken Flows
Run through these flows and fix any breakage:
- Create a project
- Create a task (if present)
- Log a timesheet entry
- View invoices page loads without errors

Ensure:
- X-Tenant-ID header is present on all requests
- TanStack Query cache invalidation works for create/update
- Errors are surfaced (no silent failures)

5) Add Playwright E2E Smoke Tests (must)
Add tests:
A) Signup shows SOFTWARE_SERVICES and CONSULTING
B) After signup, user lands on the correct dashboard
C) From Software Services dashboard, clicking Projects opens a real Projects page (not HRMS)
D) Create Project succeeds (basic form submit)
E) Timesheets page loads and can add a timesheet (if supported)

Output:
- List of files changed
- Screenshots or route list confirming correct destinations
- E2E test run summary
