# MyBizStream UI & Backend Connectivity Verification Script
# Objective: Validate Web + Flutter UI integration, onboarding, subscriptions, and notifications

1. Modules to Test:
   - Tier 1: furniture, hrms, legal, education, tourism, logistics, real-estate
   - Tier 2: clinic, coworking, pg, salon, gym

2. Verify Dashboards:
   - Load module dashboards
   - Check stats, charts, and lists populate with API data

3. CRUD Screens:
   - For each module, test create, read, update, delete
   - Confirm changes reflect in backend via API response

4. Forms & Validation:
   - Test form validation errors
   - Test multi-step flows (e.g., employee onboarding, leave request, sales order creation)

5. Subscription & Feature Gating:
   - For each tenant, verify module access matches subscription tier
   - Confirm premium features (multi-currency, AI insights, white-label) are gated appropriately

6. Onboarding Flow:
   - Register new tenant
   - Create admin user
   - Invite users and verify role-based access (RBAC)
   - Test OTP/email verification flow
   - Confirm onboarding triggers notifications (email, WhatsApp, in-app)

7. Pagination / Filtering / Search:
   - Test server-side pagination on tables
   - Verify multi-field filtering works correctly
   - Confirm search queries return correct results

8. Mobile (Flutter) Screens:
   - Load Flutter screens for Tier 1 modules
   - Confirm live data displays correctly via API
   - Validate BLoC/state management updates UI as expected

9. Notifications:
   - Trigger sample actions (employee onboarding, leave approval, invoice generated)
   - Verify in-app, email, and WhatsApp notifications appear correctly

10. Error Handling:
   - Simulate failed API responses
   - Confirm proper UI messages and fallbacks

11. Logging & Audit:
   - Confirm all actions are logged in audit_logs table
   - Verify tenant-specific logging works

12. Output / Report:
   - Generate table with:
       Module | Screen | Test Result | Issue (if any)
   - Highlight failures or missing integration points
   - Confirm Web + Flutter status for each module

# Success Criteria:
# ✅ All module screens populate real data correctly
# ✅ Onboarding works for tenants/users
# ✅ Subscription gating enforced
# ✅ Notifications triggered and visible
# ✅ Tier 1 Flutter screens fully integrated
# ✅ Tier 2 modules scaffolded correctly
