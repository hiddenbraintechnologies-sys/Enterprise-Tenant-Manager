You are acting as a Principal Platform Architect performing a **code-level bidirectional feature parity audit** for the MyBizStream multi-tenant SaaS platform.

Context:
- There are 12 business modules (Furniture, Real Estate, Tourism, Education, Logistics, Legal, PG/Hostel, Coworking, Salon, Clinic, Gym, General).
- Furniture is currently the most feature-complete module and is proposed as the platform baseline.
- A detailed Bidirectional Feature Parity Audit document already exists (shared below).

Your task is NOT to restate the audit.
Your task is to **VERIFY it against the actual codebase** and **identify truth vs assumptions**.

### OBJECTIVES (MANDATORY)

You must perform **both directions** of comparison:

---

## A) Furniture → Other Modules (Downward Parity Check)

For **each feature implemented in Furniture**, verify whether it exists in every other module by checking:

- Controllers / routes
- Services
- Guards / middleware
- Database schemas
- Tests (API, RBAC, validation)
- Flutter mobile implementation (if applicable)

For EACH feature:
1. Confirm **EXISTS / PARTIAL / MISSING**
2. Provide **exact file paths** where it exists
3. If missing, state:
   - Is this a **platform-level gap** or **intentional industry exclusion**?
   - What **breaks or risks** if it stays missing?

Examples to explicitly verify:
- InvoiceService wiring
- PaymentService + webhooks
- CurrencyService usage
- TaxCalculatorService usage
- PDF generation endpoints
- Audit logging middleware
- Guardrails (read-only enforcement, lifecycle locks)
- NotificationService (WhatsApp + Email)
- Analytics adapters
- Flutter mobile parity

---

## B) Other Modules → Furniture (Upward Parity Check)

For **each non-Furniture module**, identify **unique capabilities** that Furniture does NOT have.

For EACH such feature:
1. Confirm whether it is:
   - Platform-level reusable
   - Industry-specific only
2. State whether Furniture should:
   - MUST adopt
   - SHOULD adopt
   - CAN ignore
3. If adoptable, propose:
   - Target abstraction (shared service / adapter / hook)
   - Minimal schema or API changes required

Examples to check:
- Appointment scheduling (Clinic / Salon / Legal)
- Risk prediction AI (Education)
- Case summarization AI (Legal)
- Membership lifecycle (Gym / Coworking)
- Site visit tracking (Real Estate)

---

## C) Truth Table Output (MANDATORY FORMAT)

Produce **three tables**:

### 1️⃣ Feature Truth Table
Columns:
- Feature ID
- Feature Name
- Furniture Status
- Other Modules Status (per module)
- Verified in Code (YES/NO)
- Evidence (file paths)

### 2️⃣ False Assumptions Table
List features that:
- Were assumed present
- Are partially implemented
- Exist only as schemas without services

### 3️⃣ Normalization Readiness Table
Columns:
- Module
- Baseline Compliance %
- Blocking Gaps
- Estimated Effort to Normalize (Low/Medium/High)

## D) B
