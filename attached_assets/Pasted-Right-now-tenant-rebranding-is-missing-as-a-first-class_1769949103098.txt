Right now, tenant rebranding is missing as a first-class feature, which is why you don’t see it in Settings. This is not a user mistake; it’s a product gap 👍

Let me break it down clearly and then give you a clean, SaaS-correct way to implement tenant rebranding without breaking your architecture.

What “Tenant Rebranding” should mean (proper SaaS definition)

A tenant should be able to customize only their own brand layer, not the product behavior.

✅ Allowed to customize

Company name

Logo (light & dark)

Favicon

Primary / secondary brand colors

Invoice / payslip branding

Email header/footer branding

Optional: subdomain (company.mybizstream.com)

❌ NOT allowed

Core UI structure

Feature visibility (RBAC controls that)

Global platform colors (super-admin only)

Why you don’t see it now (root cause)

From your current setup:

Settings mostly cover account / security / billing

No Brand / Appearance / Company Profile module exists

No tenant-level branding table or config is wired to UI

Frontend theme is static (Tailwind + shadcn defaults)

So tenants cannot rebrand even if they want to.

This is expected at MVP stage.

Correct UX placement (what tenants expect)

Add this in Settings → Company → Branding

Settings
 └── Company
     ├── Profile
     ├── Branding   ← (NEW)
     ├── Locations
     ├── Business Hours
     └── Compliance

What the Branding screen should contain (V1 – practical)
1️⃣ Company Identity

Company Name (display name)

Legal Name (for invoices)

Upload Logo (PNG/SVG)

Upload Favicon (32×32)

2️⃣ Theme Colors

Primary color (buttons, highlights)

Secondary color (badges, accents)

Preview panel (live)

⚠️ Restrict palette to avoid ugly UIs
(eg: allow only HEX, validate contrast)

3️⃣ Document Branding

Invoice header logo

Payslip footer note

Address + registration number

4️⃣ Email Branding

Email header logo

Footer text

Support email

Backend design (important – multi-tenant safe)
Table: tenant_branding
tenant_id (PK, FK)
company_name
logo_url
favicon_url
primary_color
secondary_color
invoice_logo_url
email_logo_url
created_at
updated_at


✔ One row per tenant
✔ Loaded on login + cached

Frontend implementation (Tailwind + shadcn friendly)
Theme injection approach (safe)

On tenant login → fetch /api/tenant/branding

Store in global store (Zustand / Context)

Inject CSS variables dynamically:

:root {
  --brand-primary: #2563eb;
  --brand-secondary: #0ea5e9;
}


Use in Tailwind:

colors: {
  brand: {
    primary: "var(--brand-primary)",
    secondary: "var(--brand-secondary)",
  }
}


This avoids rebuilding Tailwind per tenant ❗

Super Admin vs Tenant control (important)
Feature	Tenant	Super Admin
Logo	✅	❌
Colors	✅	❌
Company Name	✅	❌
Platform Name	❌	✅
Default Theme	❌	✅
Marketplace Branding	❌	✅
Why this matters for your product

Without tenant rebranding:

Product feels generic

Enterprises will reject it

Invoices/payslips look unprofessional

White-label upsell becomes impossible

With rebranding:

You unlock White-Label plan

Higher ARPU

Stronger tenant ownership feeling

Minimal Replit master prompt (you can copy-paste)

Implement tenant rebranding in MyBizStream:

Add Settings → Company → Branding page

Create tenant_branding table (1 row per tenant)

APIs: GET/PUT /api/tenant/branding

Support logo, favicon, primary & secondary colors

Inject branding via CSS variables (no Tailwind rebuild)

Apply branding to sidebar, buttons, invoices, payslips, and emails

Ensure strict tenant isolation
