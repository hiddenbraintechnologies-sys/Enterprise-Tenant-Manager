Implement Monthly vs Yearly billing (Zoho-style) with Super Admin control.

GOAL:
- Plans support multiple billing cycles (monthly + yearly).
- Tenant packages page shows toggle and savings.
- Subscriptions store selected billing cycle.
- Paid upgrades activate only after payment success (existing rule).

1) Database
Update billing_plans table to support cycle pricing.

Option A (recommended): JSON pricing map
Add column:
- billing_cycles jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb

Structure example:
{
  "monthly": { "enabled": true, "price": 99 },
  "yearly":  { "enabled": true, "price": 999, "badge": "Save 16%" }
}

Also add:
- default_cycle text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'monthly'

Backfill for India plans:
- Free: monthly enabled price 0, yearly disabled or 0
- Basic: monthly 99, yearly 999
- Pro: monthly 199, yearly 1999
Set default_cycle='monthly'

2) API changes
A) GET /api/billing/plans?country=IN
Return each plan with:
- currencyCode
- billingCycles (monthly/yearly enabled + prices)
- defaultCycle
Also include computed fields:
- yearlySavingsAmount = monthly.price*12 - yearly.price
- yearlySavingsPercent = round((savings / (monthly*12))*100)

B) POST /api/billing/quote
Body: { planCode, cycle: "monthly"|"yearly" }
Return: { amount, currencyCode, cycle, savingsAmount?, savingsPercent? }

3) Subscription model
Ensure subscription stores cycle:
- billingCycle (monthly|yearly)
- pendingBillingCycle (for pending upgrades)

When upgrade requested:
- set pendingPlanId + pendingBillingCycle
- create Payment for quote.amount

On payment success verification:
- planId = pendingPlanId
- billingCycle = pendingBillingCycle
- clear pending fields

4) Super Admin UI (Plan Builder)
In Plan Builder modal add “Billing Cycles” section:
- Monthly toggle (enabled) + price input
- Yearly toggle (enabled) + price input
- Show read-only computed: “Save ₹X (Y%)”
- Allow optional badge text for yearly (e.g., “2 months free”)

Validate:
- If country=IN, currency must be INR (existing)
- yearly price must be <= monthly*12 (otherwise warn but allow if needed)
- Free plan yearly disabled by default

5) Tenant UI (/packages)
Add a UI toggle:
[ Monthly ] [ Yearly (Save X%) ]

When user switches toggle:
- all plan cards update price display:
  monthly: “₹99 / month”
  yearly: “₹999 / year” + “Save ₹189”
- CTA uses selected cycle:
  upgrade POST /api/billing/subscription/change includes cycle

6) Tests
- API returns correct savings for India plans
- quote endpoint returns correct amount
- upgrading with yearly stores billingCycle='yearly' only after payment success
- UI renders “Save X%” and yearly amount correctly

Acceptance:
- Tenant can select Monthly/Yearly on packages
- Super Admin can edit yearly amounts
- Savings are computed correctly
- Subscription records chosen cycle
