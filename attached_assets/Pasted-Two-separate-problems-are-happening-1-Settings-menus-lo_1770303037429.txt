Two separate problems are happening:

1) Settings menus look “empty / nothing visible”

In the video, when you open Settings, the left sidebar shows Settings but the settings content area is basically blank/doesn’t show the expected sub-menus.

Most common cause in your app

Your Settings sub-menu items are being filtered out (by rollout/modules/permissions), so the array becomes [] and the UI renders nothing.

Fix (recommended behavior)

Always show at least “Profile” in Settings (no permission gating)

If after filtering there are still 0 items, show an Empty State instead of a blank page.

Patch idea (client)

In client/src/.../settings-nav.ts (or wherever you build the settings menu):

const baseItems = [
  { id: "profile", label: "Profile", href: "/settings/profile", always: true },
];

const gatedItems = [
  // business branding, billing, security, etc...
].filter(item => item.always || canAccess(item));
  
const items = [...baseItems, ...gatedItems];

// UI should render empty state if items.length === 0 (should never happen with baseItems)

Also add UI fallback

If items.length === 0 (shouldn’t happen), render:

“No settings available for your role”

“Contact admin to enable permissions/modules”

Quick debug to confirm

Open DevTools console on Settings page and log:

the final settings menu array length

the permissions/modules used for filtering

If it’s 0, that’s exactly why you see “nothing”.

2) Profile picture cannot be updated

On your Profile screen, I can clearly see this line:

“Managed externally”

That means your user is authenticated via SSO/provider and your UI is intentionally locking avatar edits (likely using provider profile photo only).

Two valid product options

Option A (fastest): Keep external management

Keep “Managed externally”

Add a helper link text:
“Change your profile photo in Google/Microsoft and re-login.”

Option B (best UX): Allow local avatar override even for SSO
This is what Zoho-like systems do.

Backend

Add users.avatarUrl column (nullable).

Add endpoint:

POST /api/me/avatar (multipart upload)

store image (S3/R2/local) and set users.avatarUrl

Frontend

If avatarUrl exists → use it

Else use provider picture

Show “Upload photo” even for SSO, and label it “Overrides external photo”

Pseudo:

const displayAvatar = user.avatarUrl ?? user.providerPicture ?? fallback;

What you should do now (exact next steps)

Find where Settings menu items are filtered (modules/permissions)

Make “Profile” always visible

Add empty-state message if nothing else is available

Decide avatar behavior:

If you want Zoho-like → implement local override (Option B)

If not → add “Change via provider” guidance + refresh behavior
