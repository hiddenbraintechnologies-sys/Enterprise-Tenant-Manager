You are working on a multi-tenant SaaS (MyBizStream). Production has duplicate-email issues because old tenant/user data still exists and is linked (projects, invoices, timesheets). We need Super Admin tools to delete users and/or wipe tenants including linked data.

Build the following:

A) Prisma
1. Ensure all tenant-owned tables reference tenantId and are deletable safely.
2. Prefer onDelete: Cascade relations for tenant -> child entities where appropriate.
3. Add fields:
   - Tenant.deletedAt DateTime?
   - Tenant.isProtected Boolean @default(false)
   - User.deletedAt DateTime?
4. If cascade cannot be applied everywhere, implement a manual wipe script using Prisma transaction deleting in correct order.

B) API (Super Admin only, RBAC protected)
1. POST /api/super-admin/tenants/:tenantId/wipe
   - Requires confirmText "DELETE TENANT"
   - If tenant.isProtected=true, return 403
   - Wipes ALL data for that tenant across all modules (projects, timesheets, invoices, clients, notifications, audit logs, etc.)
   - Returns {status:"queued", jobId}
2. POST /api/super-admin/tenants/:tenantId/users/:userId/delete
   - Supports mode: "deactivate" | "deleteUserOnly" | "deleteUserAndData"
   - For deleteUserAndData: delete data createdBy=userId within that tenant (projects, engagements, timesheets, invoices, etc.)
   - Must not affect other tenants
3. Add GET /api/super-admin/tenants/:tenantId/delete-summary and GET /api/super-admin/tenants/:tenantId/users/:userId/delete-summary
   - Returns counts per table so UI can show impact before deletion.

C) Background job
Implement a simple job table (DeleteJob) with status: queued/running/success/failed and progress.
Wipe endpoints should enqueue jobs and execute safely (avoid request timeout).

D) UI
1. Super Admin > Tenants table: add "Wipe Tenant Data" action.
   - Opens modal with red warning
   - Shows delete-summary counts
   - Requires typing: DELETE <tenantName>
   - Requires reason
   - Calls wipe endpoint and shows job progress.
2. Super Admin > Tenant Users page: add "Delete user + data" action.
   - Shows user delete-summary
   - Requires typing: DELETE USER
   - Calls user delete endpoint

E) Audit logging
Log every wipe/delete action with superAdminId, tenantId, targetUserId, reason, timestamp, result.

Make sure all endpoints return clear errors instead of crashing. Ensure strict tenant scoping.
