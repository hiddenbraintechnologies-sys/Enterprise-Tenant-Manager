Yes — do it like this: Country selection drives the allowed language list, and the header shows a Language dropdown that changes based on the selected country.

What the UX should be
Global landing /

Header shows:

Country selector (IN / MY / UK / AE / SG…)

Language selector (options depend on country)

On first visit:

Ask for Country

Then auto-pick default language for that country (but user can change)

Country pages like /in, /my

Keep the same header selectors.

If someone opens /my, set country = MY automatically, then show MY languages.

Country → Language mapping (recommended)

Use a single mapping object:

India (IN): en-IN, hi-IN (later add ta-IN, te-IN, etc.)

Malaysia (MY): en-MY, ms-MY, zh-Hans-MY, ta-MY

UK (UK): en-GB (optional: cy-GB later)

UAE (AE): en-AE, ar-AE

Singapore (SG): en-SG, zh-Hans-SG, ms-SG, ta-SG (optional based on your target)

Also define defaults:

IN → en-IN (or hi-IN if India-first Hindi)

MY → en-MY

AE → en-AE

UK → en-GB

SG → en-SG

Logic rules (important)

When country changes

If current language is not allowed in that country → automatically switch to that country’s default language.

Persist selection

localStorage: selectedCountry, selectedLanguage

Cookie too (if you already use it), so backend can read later.

Routing

Country routes (/in, /my) should set the country but not force language (unless language becomes invalid).

Replit prompt (paste this)
Implement country-specific language selection in the landing pages.

Requirements:
1) Add a Language selector in the landing header (next to Country selector).
2) Language options must depend on selected country using a single source of truth mapping object.
   Example mapping:
   IN: [en-IN, hi-IN]
   MY: [en-MY, ms-MY, zh-Hans-MY, ta-MY]
   UK: [en-GB]
   AE: [en-AE, ar-AE]
   SG: [en-SG] (optionally add zh-Hans-SG/ms-SG/ta-SG)
3) Add default language per country:
   IN->en-IN, MY->en-MY, UK->en-GB, AE->en-AE, SG->en-SG
4) Behavior:
   - When country changes: if current language is not allowed, auto-switch to default language for that country.
   - Persist both selections in localStorage and cookie (same approach as existing country persistence).
   - On first visit to global landing (/), open Country selector modal; after choosing country, auto-set default language.
5) Country routes (/in, /my, /uk, /uae, /sg) must set the country automatically on load while keeping the language if valid.
6) Ensure i18n resolver uses selectedLanguage.
7) Add tests:
   - Switching country updates available languages.
   - Invalid language auto-falls back to country default.
   - Selections persist across reload.

Deliver:
- Updated landing layout header with Country + Language selectors
- Mapping + persistence + tests
- No changes to auth flows or dashboard routes


If you want, I can also give you the exact label strings for the selector UI (English + local language labels), e.g. Bahasa Melayu, 中文(简体), தமிழ், etc.
