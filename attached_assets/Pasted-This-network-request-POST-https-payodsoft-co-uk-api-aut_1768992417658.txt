This network request, POST https://payodsoft.co.uk/api/auth/register, is an attempt to register a new user on the payodsoft.co.uk platform. The content-type: application/json header in the request indicates that the user registration data is being sent in JSON format. The origin and referer headers confirm that the request originated from the registration page of the same site, https://payodsoft.co.uk/register.

Potential Issues:

Status Code (500 Internal Server Error): The primary reason the request is failing is indicated by the 500 Internal Server Error status code. This means that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This is a general error message, and the server's specific problem is not directly communicated to the client via the status code itself.
Response Body ({"message":"Registration failed"}): The response body explicitly states "Registration failed". This message, combined with the 500 status code, strongly suggests an issue on the server side during the registration process. It could be due to:
Invalid or missing data: The server might have received an incomplete or improperly formatted registration payload, leading to a validation error.
Database issues: Problems connecting to or writing to the user database.
Internal server logic errors: Bugs in the server-side code handling the registration.
Duplicate user: Attempting to register a user with credentials (e.g., email, username) that already exist in the system, though a 409 Conflict or 400 Bad Request might be more appropriate in such a case.
External service failure: If the registration process relies on other services (e.g., email verification, CAPTCHA), a failure in one of those could lead to a 500 error.
Timing Analysis:

The request timing shows a Waiting for server response (duration): 800 ms, which is the longest phase of the request. While not excessively long for a server-side process, it indicates that the server spent a significant amount of time processing the request before returning the 500 error. This duration includes the time the server took to encounter and handle the error condition, further suggesting that the issue lies within the server's internal logic or its dependencies. The relatively low Content download (duration): 0.7 ms indicates that the server response was small, as expected for an error message.

Recommendations for a Software Engineer:

Check Server Logs: The most crucial step is to examine the server-side logs for the payodsoft.co.uk application. A 500 error will almost certainly have detailed error messages, stack traces, or other diagnostic information logged on the server. This will pinpoint the exact cause of the registration failure.
Verify Request Payload: Ensure that the client-side code is sending the correct and complete user registration data in the POST request body. Look for required fields that might be missing or data types that are incorrect.
Reproduce Locally: If possible, try to reproduce the error in a development environment to debug the server-side code directly.
Improve Error Handling: The server's response {"message":"Registration failed"} is generic. For a better user and developer experience, the server should ideally return more specific error messages (e.g., "Email already registered," "Password too weak," "Invalid input for field X") with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 409 Conflict) instead of a general 500 error, unless it's truly an unrecoverable internal server issue.
