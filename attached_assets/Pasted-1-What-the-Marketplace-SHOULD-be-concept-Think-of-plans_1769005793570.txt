1️⃣ What the Marketplace SHOULD be (concept)

Think of plans as foundation and Marketplace as expansion packs.

Plan → sets limits + core access

Add-ons → unlock optional capabilities on top of the plan

User pays only for what they need

This avoids:

Overpricing Basic/Pro

Feature bloat

Churn from SMBs

2️⃣ What Add-ons you should add (realistic & sellable)
🔹 Core Business Add-ons (High priority)

These are perfect because users actively ask for them later.

Add-on	Why it works	Pricing idea (India)
Payroll	Compliance + recurring need	₹49–₹99 / employee / month
HRMS Advanced	Leave, attendance, policies	₹999 / month
GST Filing Pack	Huge India value	₹499 / month
WhatsApp Automation	High perceived value	₹799 / month
Advanced Analytics	Owners love reports	₹499 / month
Document Management	Needed for clinics/legal	₹299 / month
Multi-Branch Support	Growing businesses	₹999 / month
API Access	For tech teams	₹499 / month

✅ These should not all be bundled in Pro — sell them separately.

🔹 Usage / Limit Add-ons (very powerful)

Instead of forcing plan upgrade 👇

Add-on	Example
Extra Users	+5 users for ₹199
Extra Storage	+10GB for ₹99
Extra Invoices	+1,000 invoices
Extra Projects	+10 projects

This dramatically reduces downgrade friction.

🔹 Country-specific Add-ons (your secret weapon)
Country	Add-ons
India	GST, Payroll (India), WhatsApp
Malaysia	Payroll (EPF, SOCSO), HRMS
UK	PAYE Payroll, VAT
UAE	WPS Payroll (later)

Marketplace can auto-filter by country 👌

3️⃣ How Marketplace should behave (UX logic)
Browse Add-ons tab

Each card shows:

Add-on name

What it unlocks

Price

“Compatible with your plan” badge

Add / Installed state

Install flow

Click Add

Show confirmation:

“Payroll will be added for ₹99/employee/month”

If paid:

Immediate Razorpay subscription / invoice

Feature becomes active instantly

4️⃣ How it interacts with Plans (IMPORTANT)
Example scenario

User on Basic Plan ₹99

Feature	Status
Payroll	❌ Not included
Marketplace → Payroll	✅ Can add
HRMS Basic	✅ Included
HRMS Advanced	➕ Add-on

This keeps plans simple and Marketplace powerful.

5️⃣ How to model this technically (simple mental model)

You already have most of this.

Conceptually:

plans → base access

features → capabilities

tenant_features → enabled via plan OR add-on

addons → purchasable feature bundles

Add-on = feature override with billing

6️⃣ What NOT to put in Marketplace ❌

Avoid:

Core navigation (Dashboard, Clients)

Basic CRUD features

Security essentials

Those belong in plans.

7️⃣ What you can show on the Marketplace page (right now)

To avoid “empty” feeling, start with:

Phase 1 (launch-ready)

Payroll (disabled if country not ready)

WhatsApp Automation

Advanced Analytics

Extra Users

Extra Storage

Even 3–4 add-ons is enough to look serious.

8️⃣ Why this is a BIG win for you

✅ Lower entry price
✅ Higher ARPU over time
✅ Country-wise compliance control
✅ Less plan churn
✅ Easy upsell by sales team
