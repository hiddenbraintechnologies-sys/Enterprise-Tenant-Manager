yes, this design is good and totally acceptable 👍
Longer answer: it’s ~80–85% there, and with a few small refinements it will feel properly “enterprise SaaS” instead of “early-stage”.

I’ll break this down clearly.

What you did RIGHT (important)
✅ 1. Separation is correct

Appearance → only Theme

Business → business-related settings

Company Branding moved out of Appearance ✅
This is the correct mental model.

✅ 2. Visual hierarchy is clear

Section titles are readable

Cards are well separated

No confusing mixed concerns (huge win)

✅ 3. Navigation flow makes sense

Settings → Business → Branding feels logical

Users won’t feel lost

✅ 4. Branding as a dedicated page is correct

Logo + favicon + colors together = ✅

Live preview on the side = very professional touch

Overall: you’re not wrong at all. This won’t confuse users.

Where it still feels “a bit long” (and how to fix it)

These are polish-level improvements, not rework.

🔧 1. Settings landing page is still doing too much

Right now:

Appearance

Company Branding entry

Business form
…all on one screen

Suggestion (lightweight, not a redesign):
Turn Settings into a hub, not a form page.

Recommended structure

/settings

Appearance (Theme only)

Business → “Configure your business settings”

Branding → “Logo, colors, email branding”

Clicking Business opens the business form
Clicking Branding opens branding page

This alone reduces scroll by ~50%.

🔧 2. Business form can be visually tighter

Your Business card is correct, but:

Improvements

Group fields into 2 rows:

Row 1: Business Name | Business Type

Row 2: Timezone | Currency

Put Save Changes aligned right, sticky bottom if possible

This makes it feel more “ERP / Zoho / Stripe-like”.

🔧 3. Reduce repeated “Upgrade to Pro” noise

The Pro banner is fine, but:

On Settings pages, it’s distracting

Users are configuring, not browsing plans

Better pattern

Show Pro banner:

Once per session

Or only on Billing / Add-ons pages

Allow dismiss (remember dismissal)

This is subtle, but it matters for enterprise feel.

🔧 4. Naming tweak (small but important)

Instead of:

Company Branding
Customize logo, colors, and email branding

Consider:

Branding
Logo, colors, and communication identity

Cleaner and less repetitive.

Verdict (honest)
Is this design OK?

✅ Yes — absolutely OK

Is it production-ready?

✅ Yes

Is it enterprise-polished?

🟡 Almost — just needs:

Settings as a hub (not a long form)

Slight tightening of Business section

Less upsell noise in settings

If you want a final “stamp of approval” layout

This is what I’d ship:

Settings

Appearance (Theme)

Business → opens /settings/business

Branding → opens /settings/branding

Billing → opens /settings/billing

Each page:

Max 1–2 cards

No long scrolling

Clear Save action
