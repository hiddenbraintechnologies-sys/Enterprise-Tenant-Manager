You are acting as the platform architect for MyBizStream.

The Furniture Manufacturing module is now the most complete and production-hardened module on the platform, including:
- Full CRUD with server-side pagination, filtering, sorting
- Financial validation & guardrails
- Multi-currency & multi-country tax compliance
- Invoice & payment lifecycle
- PDF generation
- WhatsApp & email notifications
- Recurring billing & reminders
- RBAC & tenant isolation
- Audit logging
- Flutter mobile parity
- Integration tests
- Analytics & AI insights

TASK:
Perform a **comprehensive feature parity audit** across ALL other business modules, including but not limited to:

- PG / Hostel Management
- Co-working Spaces
- Salons & Beauty Parlours
- Clinics & Diagnostics
- Coaching / Education Institutes
- Gyms & Membership Businesses
- Logistics & Fleet
- Real Estate Agencies
- Tourism
- Legal & Consulting Firms
- General Service Businesses

────────────────────────
1️⃣ Feature Parity Matrix
────────────────────────
Create a comparison table:
- Rows = platform features
- Columns = business modules
- Status per cell:
  ✅ Fully implemented
  ⚠️ Partially implemented
  ❌ Missing

Feature categories must include:
- Core CRUD & pagination
- Server-side filtering & search
- Financial validation
- Invoicing & payments
- Multi-currency support
- Country-specific tax logic
- PDF generation
- WhatsApp & email notifications
- Recurring billing
- RBAC & tenant isolation
- Audit logging
- Mobile (Flutter) support
- Analytics dashboards
- AI insights
- Compliance modules

────────────────────────
2️⃣ Gap Identification
────────────────────────
For each module, list:
- Missing features
- Partially implemented features
- Any deviations from Furniture module standards
- Backend vs Frontend vs Mobile gaps

────────────────────────
3️⃣ Risk Assessment
────────────────────────
Identify:
- Features that could cause data inconsistency
- Missing guardrails (financial, lifecycle, RBAC)
- Mobile/web mismatch risks
- Compliance exposure by country

────────────────────────
4️⃣ Normalization Strategy
────────────────────────
Propose a **platform-wide normalization plan**:
- Which features should be abstracted into shared services
- Which features should remain industry-specific
- Recommended order to bring all modules to parity

────────────────────────
5️⃣ Output Required
────────────────────────
- Feature parity matrix
- Written gap analysis per module
- Recommended remediation roadmap (phased)
- Confirmation whether Furniture module can be treated as the **platform baseline**

NO code changes required.
THIS IS AN ARCHITECTURAL & AUDIT EXERCISE ONLY.
