Nice — at this point your registration + anti-abuse + audit trail is in really solid shape. If you want the highest ROI next, here are the next 10 things I’d harden in a multi-tenant SaaS like yours (ordered by impact). Pick any and I’ll give you a ready-to-run prompt + tests like we did before.

1) Email verification + risk-based onboarding gate

Even with MX warn/flag, you’ll still get real spam. Add:

verify email link (token + expiry)

allow login but block tenant activation / billing checkout until verified (or “limited mode”)

2) Password policy + breach checking

enforce minimum entropy (not just length)

optional: check against known breached passwords (k-anonymity API or local list)

rate-limit login separately + lockout/backoff

3) Session security

rotate session on login

set cookie flags: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax/Strict

CSRF protection if you use cookies + state-changing endpoints

shorten session TTL + refresh tokens if needed

4) Multi-tenant authorization audit

Do a sweep to ensure every tenant-scoped route has:

requireAuth

requireTenantContext

tenantId scoping on every DB query (no “findFirst without tenant filter”)
Add a test harness to catch future leaks.

5) Add-on enforcement completeness

You already started this. Next steps:

enforce server-side on every module API route (payroll/hrms/attendance/etc.)

add “fail closed” UI gating everywhere

add grace = read-only vs write blocks (GET allowed, POST blocked)

6) Stripe/payment hardening (since you had PAYMENT_SETUP_FAILED earlier)

strict env validation on boot

price mapping per region/currency

webhook idempotency (dedupe events)

reconcile job: compare Stripe subscription status vs DB entitlements

7) Logging hygiene

redact PII/secrets (email, tokens, password fields)

structured logs with request id, tenant id, user id

store audit logs but keep them lean (avoid storing sensitive raw payloads)

8) File upload + XSS/HTML safety (if you allow logos, docs, etc.)

content-type checking

size limits

virus scan (later)

sanitize any user-provided HTML; escape by default

9) Input validation consistency across all endpoints

You fixed registration; repeat pattern across:

profile update

tenant name / business profile

employee creation (names, IC/passport formats)

address fields

10) Security headers + dependency scanning

Helmet headers

CSP (even a basic one helps)

npm audit + dependabot-like process
