You are acting as the Chief Platform Architect for MyBizStream.

The platform contains multiple industry modules.
The Furniture Manufacturing module is currently the most production-hardened, but other modules may contain features not yet present in Furniture.

TASK:
Perform a **BIDIRECTIONAL FEATURE PARITY AUDIT** across all business modules.

This audit must answer BOTH questions:
1) What features from the Furniture module are missing or incomplete in other modules?
2) What features from other modules are missing or incomplete in the Furniture module?

────────────────────────
MODULES IN SCOPE
────────────────────────
- Furniture Manufacturing (baseline candidate)
- PG / Hostel Management
- Co-working Spaces
- Salons & Beauty Parlours
- Clinics & Diagnostics
- Coaching / Education Institutes
- Gyms & Membership Businesses
- Logistics & Fleet
- Real Estate Agencies
- Tourism
- Legal & Consulting Firms
- General Service Businesses

────────────────────────
1️⃣ Unified Feature Inventory
────────────────────────
Create a **single master feature inventory** across the entire platform, including:

Core Platform:
- Multi-tenancy & tenant isolation
- RBAC & admin hierarchy
- Audit logging
- Feature flags
- White-label & branding
- Mobile (Flutter) parity

Operational:
- CRUD + pagination + filtering
- Lifecycle state machines
- Read-only enforcement
- Bulk operations
- Import/export

Financial:
- Invoicing
- Payments
- Multi-currency
- Country-specific tax logic
- PDF generation
- Recurring billing & reminders

Communication:
- WhatsApp
- Email
- Notifications & templates

Compliance:
- India, UAE, UK, Malaysia, US
- Healthcare compliance where applicable

Intelligence:
- Analytics dashboards
- AI insights
- Reporting & exports

Industry-Specific:
- Appointments (clinics, salons)
- Beds/rooms (PG/hostels)
- Memberships (gyms)
- Route optimization (logistics)
- Property listings (real estate)
- Student lifecycle (education)

────────────────────────
2️⃣ Bidirectional Parity Matrix
────────────────────────
Produce a table where:
- Rows = features (from unified inventory)
- Columns = modules
- Each cell clearly marked as:
  ✅ Fully implemented
  ⚠️ Partially implemented
  ❌ Missing

Furniture MUST be included as a column like all others.

────────────────────────
3️⃣ Directional Gap Analysis
────────────────────────

A) Furniture → Others
- For each module, list features present in Furniture but missing elsewhere
- Highlight risks caused by missing guardrails or validations

B) Others → Furniture
- Identify features present in other modules but NOT in Furniture
- Explain whether they are:
  • Industry-specific (OK to exclude)
  • Platform-level (should be added to Furniture)

────────────────────────
4️⃣ Risk & Consistency Assessment
────────────────────────
Identify:
- Platform inconsistencies
- Financial or compliance gaps
- Mobile vs web mismatches
- RBAC or tenant isolation deviations

────────────────────────
5️⃣ Normalization & Baseline Recommendation
────────────────────────
Based on findings:
- Should Furniture become the **official platform baseline**? (Yes/No + justification)
- What features must be added to Furniture to make it baseline-complete?
- What features should be extracted into shared platform services?

────────────────────────
6️⃣ Output Requirements
────────────────────────
- Feature parity matrix
- Two-way gap analysis (Furniture ↔ Others)
- Risk summary
- Recommended normalization roadmap (phased)
- Clear architectural recommendation

IMPORTANT:
This is a **design & audit tas**
