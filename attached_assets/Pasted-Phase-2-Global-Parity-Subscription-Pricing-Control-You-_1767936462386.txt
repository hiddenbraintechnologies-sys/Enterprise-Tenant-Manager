Phase 2 Global Parity + Subscription & Pricing Control

You are working on MyBizStream, a multi-tenant SaaS platform with multiple business modules (Furniture, HRMS, Clinic, Coworking, PG/Hostel, Salon, Gym, Legal, Education, etc.) built with a shared backend and Flutter mobile app (BLoC + Dio + Hive + Firebase).

Objective

Perform a comprehensive parity audit and execution plan across all business modules, while enabling subscription-based feature access with per-country pricing and platform-owner control.

1️⃣ Feature Parity Verification (Global Scope)

Treat ALL features as global, but control access via subscriptions.

Compare Furniture + HRMS (Tier-1) modules against all other business modules.

Identify:

Features implemented in Furniture/HRMS but missing in other modules

Features implemented in other modules but missing in Furniture/HRMS

Cover:

Backend APIs

Business rules & guardrails

Financials (invoicing, payments, taxes, currency)

Notifications

Audit logging

Analytics

Pagination & server-side filtering

RBAC & tenant isolation

Flutter mobile parity (models, repositories, BLoCs, UI)

2️⃣ Subscription & Pricing Control

Feature access controlled via subscription packages:

Platform Owners can create new subscription cards/packages

Managers can assign modules/features to tenants based on subscriptions

Pricing can be individual per country and adjustable by platform owners

All modules must support subscription-based gating

E.g., Furniture, HRMS, Legal, Education, Tourism, Logistics, Real Estate, PG/Hostel, Coworking, Clinic, Salon, Gym

Track active subscription per tenant, enforce feature access in backend & mobile

3️⃣ Phase 2 Parity Rollout Plan

Create a Module × Feature × Sprint × Subscription matrix:

Rows: All modules

Columns: Global features

Cells: Existing / Missing / Partial / Subscription Gated

Define sprint-wise rollout order to achieve 100% parity

Include subscription package creation, assignment, and country pricing setup in plan

4️⃣ Module Maturity Score (Sales & Pricing)

Design Module Maturity Score (0–100) based on:

Backend completeness

Business guardrails

Financial readiness

Audit & compliance

Mobile (Flutter) parity

Notifications & analytics

Subscription support

Production hardening

Classify modules into:

MVP

Growth Ready

Enterprise Ready

5️⃣ Output Required

Parity gap report

Vice-versa comparison table

Phase 2 rollout matrix including subscription gating

Module maturity scoring framework

Subscription management framework:

Platform owner control for creating new subscription cards/packages

Pricing per country

Feature assignment per subscription

Clear recommendation on:

Which modules are GA-ready

Which are subscription gated

Pricing & sales eligibility impact

Use existing codebase and documentation as source of truth.
Do not design new features — only normalize, implement parity, and enable subscription-based access.
