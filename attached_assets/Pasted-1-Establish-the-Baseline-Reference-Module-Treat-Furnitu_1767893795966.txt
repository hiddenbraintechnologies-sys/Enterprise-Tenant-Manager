1️⃣ Establish the Baseline (Reference Module)

Treat Furniture as the platform reference implementation.

Confirm it has:

End-to-end financial lifecycle (invoice → tax → currency → payments → PDF)

Financial guardrails and immutability

Server-side pagination, filtering, sorting

Notifications (Email + WhatsApp)

Analytics + AI insights

Audit logging on all critical paths

RBAC + tenant isolation

Flutter mobile parity

Explicitly state if any of these are missing or partially implemented.

2️⃣ Downward Parity Check (Furniture → Other Modules)

For each module (Real Estate, Tourism, Education, Logistics, Legal, Clinic, Salon, PG/Hostel, Coworking, Gym, General):

Verify in code:

Do server routes exist or only schemas?

Are shared services actually imported and used?

currencyService

taxCalculatorService

invoicePDFService

notificationService

whatsappService

analyticsService

Are financial guardrails enforced?

Is auditService wired on mutations?

Is RBAC + tenant isolation enforced at route level?

Is pagination/filtering server-side?

Does a Flutter mobile feature directory exist?

Output:

A truth table with:

✅ Implemented

⚠️ Partial (explain what’s missing)

❌ Missing (no wiring / no routes)

Include file paths as evidence.

3️⃣ Upward Parity Check (Others → Furniture)

Identify platform-level features implemented in other modules that:

Are reusable

Are NOT industry-specific

Could improve Furniture

Specifically check:

Appointment scheduling (Legal / Clinic)

AI risk prediction (Education)

AI document summarization (Legal)

State clearly:

SHOULD ADD

COULD ADD

SHOULD NOT ADD
(with justification)

4️⃣ Shared Services Reality Check

For each shared service:

Confirm it exists

Confirm which modules actually import it

Identify if it is Furniture-coupled

Output a table:

Service | Exists | Furniture Uses | Other Modules Use | Action Required

5️⃣ Mobile Parity Verification

Inspect mobile/lib/features/ and report:

Which modules have Flutter implementations

Which are missing entirely

Which are partial

Furniture should be the mobile reference.

6️⃣ Normalization Readiness Score

For every module, assign:

Baseline Compliance %

Blocking gaps

Estimated effort (Low / Medium / High)

This must be based on code reality, not assumptions.

7️⃣ Recommendations (Actionable)

Produce:

A short list of services to abstract immediately

A phased normalization roadmap

A clear answer to:

Is Furniture the correct platform baseline? (Yes/No, why)

Are shared services ready for reuse? (Yes/No, why)

Which module should be normalized next?

8️⃣ Output Rules (Strict)

No marketing language

No assumptions

No future promises

Every claim must be backed by:

File path

Import usage

Route existence

If something does not exist in code, mark it ❌
