We need a GLOBAL landing setup + country-specific variants, while keeping ONE codebase.
Do NOT touch auth/RBAC/dashboard logic. Marketing pages only.

Goal:
- Default global landing at /
- India landing at /in (with INR pricing)
- Country selector + “Change country” switch
- Placeholder pages for /uk, /uae, /sg, /my (coming soon)
- Store selection in cookie/localStorage and route accordingly

================================================
1) Routes to create
================================================
/                 -> Global landing (neutral copy, no INR)
/in               -> India landing (INR pricing: Free/₹99/₹199)
/uk               -> UK landing placeholder (Coming soon)
/uae              -> UAE landing placeholder (Coming soon)
/sg               -> Singapore landing placeholder (Coming soon)
/my               -> Malaysia landing placeholder (Coming soon)

Add a shared layout component used by all landings.

================================================
2) Global landing page ( / )
================================================
Copy tone: neutral + global credibility
- Headline: “Business management platform for growing teams”
- Subheadline: “One dashboard for operations, invoicing, payments, and compliance.”
- CTA:
  - “Start Free” -> /register
  - “Choose Country” -> opens country selector modal
- Show supported modules (Software/Consulting/Furniture/Clinics/Co-working/PG/Services)
- Mention: “Launching country-specific pricing & compliance packs.”

Pricing section:
- Do NOT show INR.
- Show: “Local pricing available by country” with selector.

================================================
3) India landing page ( /in )
================================================
Use the approved India launch copy + INR pricing table:
FREE ₹0 / BASIC ₹99 / PRO ₹199
Add GST + WhatsApp mentions.
CTA -> /register

================================================
4) Country selector (header + modal)
================================================
Add a country switch in the header for all landing pages:
- India
- UK
- UAE
- Singapore
- Malaysia

Behavior:
- On first visit to /:
  - open a lightweight modal: “Choose your country”
  - options: India, UK, UAE, Singapore, Malaysia
  - selection stores:
    localStorage key: selectedCountry = "IN" | "UK" | "AE" | "SG" | "MY"
    cookie (optional): country=IN
  - redirect:
    IN -> /in
    UK -> /uk
    AE -> /uae
    SG -> /sg
    MY -> /my

Add “Change country” link always visible.

================================================
5) Coming soon pages (/uk, /uae, /sg, /my)
================================================
Simple, professional placeholders:
- “We’re launching in <country> soon”
- Collect email interest (optional form that stores locally or hits an existing generic endpoint if available)
- CTA: “Back to Global” -> /

Do not show pricing here.

================================================
6) Guardrails
================================================
- No changes to application auth or dashboards
- No admin URLs exposed
- Landing pages must be fast and mobile-first
- Reuse components to avoid duplication

================================================
7) Deliverables
================================================
- New routes/pages
- Shared landing layout components
- Country selector modal
- Persistent country switch
- Verified navigation works

Output:
- List of files created/modified
- Screenshot description of / and /in
- Confirm no impact to core app flows
