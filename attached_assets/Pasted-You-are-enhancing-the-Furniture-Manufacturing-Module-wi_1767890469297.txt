You are enhancing the Furniture Manufacturing Module with automated financial workflows. The multi-country invoicing and notifications are complete. Now implement **recurring payments, auto-reminders, and scheduled billing**.

1️⃣ Recurring Payments
- Support for:
  • Fixed monthly or weekly subscriptions (e.g., maintenance, membership fees)
  • Recurring invoice generation from sales orders (if applicable)
  • Payment via UPI, card, or tenant-configured gateway
- Store recurrence schedule and last payment status in the database
- Validate:
  • Amounts match original invoice or subscription
  • Payments cannot exceed total
  • Multi-currency supported

2️⃣ Auto-Reminders
- Scheduled reminders for unpaid invoices:
  • Configurable days before/after due date
  • Multi-channel: WhatsApp + Email
  • Retry mechanism for failed delivery
- Logs each reminder event (tenant, invoice, customer, timestamp, status)

3️⃣ Scheduled Billing
- Admin-configurable schedules for:
  • Generating recurring invoices
  • Sending reminders
- System runs via cron or serverless scheduled jobs
- Prevent duplicate invoice creation for the same billing period

4️⃣ Frontend & Mobile Integration
- React dashboard:
  • Toggle recurring payments per customer/invoice
  • View upcoming scheduled payments and reminders
  • Manual trigger for sending reminders
- Flutter mobile app:
  • Display upcoming payments, due reminders
  • Trigger reminders manually if needed

5️⃣ Backend & API Endpoints
- POST /api/furniture/invoices/:id/recurring — set up recurring invoice/payment
- POST /api/furniture/invoices/:id/reminder — send manual reminder
- GET /api/furniture/invoices/scheduled — list upcoming scheduled payments/reminders
- Background scheduler handles automatic invoice creation & reminder dispatch

6️⃣ Testing & Validation
- Multi-tenant safe: each tenant only sees own scheduled payments/reminders
- Test across India, UAE, UK, Malaysia, US tenants
- Ensure notifications respect tenant templates
- Ensure payment transactions are atomic and logged

7️⃣ Completion Criteria
- Recurring invoices/payments auto-generate per schedule
- Auto-reminders sent reliably via WhatsApp and Email
- Admins can view and manage schedules on web and mobile
- Fully multi-tenant, production-ready, tested for all supported countries
