We have UI workflow issues in production. Specifically:
- On the signup page, business types like SOFTWARE_SERVICES / CONSULTING are not displaying (and possibly other types).
- Multiple workflows are not working end-to-end.

Do NOT add new features. Focus only on fixing UI/workflow issues and preventing regressions.

================================================
1) Diagnose Signup Business Type Missing Issue
================================================
Find where the signup business type list is populated.
Check all of these likely causes and fix accordingly:

A) Static enum mismatch:
- UI list is hardcoded and not updated with new business types.
- Fix: source the list from a single shared enum or API response.

B) Backend contract mismatch:
- Signup API returns business types but UI expects a different shape.
- Fix: align API + UI typing and mapping.

C) Feature-flag gating hiding options:
- Business types are hidden due to country, plan, feature flags, or environment checks.
- Fix: Ensure business type list shows correctly for India/global launch rules.
- Ensure the logic is intentional and documented.

D) Sorting/label mapping missing:
- UI uses a label map; missing keys causes items to not render.
- Fix: add label + description + icon mapping for SOFTWARE_SERVICES and CONSULTING.

Deliverable:
- Signup page shows ALL intended business types including SOFTWARE_SERVICES and CONSULTING.

================================================
2) Fix Broken Workflows (UI → API → DB)
================================================
Run a workflow audit for the following critical paths:

A) Signup → Tenant created → Dashboard redirect
- Ensure user lands on correct dashboard for their chosen business type.
- Ensure business type is immutable after onboarding.

B) Software Services Dashboard
- Create Project
- Create Task
- Create Timesheet
- List pages load with pagination & server-side filters

C) Furniture Flow
- Create Sales Order
- Create Invoice from Sales Order
- Issue/Lock invoice
- Download PDF
- Record partial payment then final payment
- Ensure UI updates statuses correctly after mutations

D) Deliveries & Installations
- Delivery list loads correctly
- Installation creation enforces completed delivery rule
- Tab switching does not break filters/pagination

For each broken workflow:
- Identify whether it’s UI state, route path, auth/tenant header, API contract, or backend validation.
- Fix the root cause with minimal changes.

================================================
3) Fix Common UI Root Causes (Must Check)
================================================
Specifically check and fix:
- Wrong API endpoint paths in frontend config (basePath mismatches)
- Missing X-Tenant-ID injection on some frontend requests
- TanStack Query cache invalidation missing after mutations
- Form schema mismatch (Zod) causing silent failures
- Role/RBAC incorrectly hiding buttons for Admin users
- Feature flags hiding pages or buttons unintentionally

================================================
4) Add UI Smoke Tests (Prevent Regression)
================================================
Add Playwright E2E tests for:

Test 1: Signup page shows SOFTWARE_SERVICES and CONSULTING business types
- Assert both options exist on page.

Test 2: Create Software Services tenant and land on correct dashboard
- Create a project successfully.

Test 3: Furniture invoice flow
- Sales order -> invoice -> PDF -> payment updates status.

Test 4: Tenant isolation sanity
- Attempt cross-tenant access returns 404.

Keep tests stable and fast.
Use existing test app helpers/seed endpoints in dev only.

================================================
5) Output Required
================================================
Provide:
- List of exact issues found (root cause per issue)
- Files changed
- Confirmation that signup business types now display correctly
- Confirmation all workflows pass manually
- E2E tests pass in CI
