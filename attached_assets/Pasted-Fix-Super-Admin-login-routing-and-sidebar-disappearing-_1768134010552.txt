Fix Super Admin login routing and sidebar disappearing issue.

Problem:
After logging in as Super Admin, user lands on /super-admin/dashboard and sees a 404 page.
When clicking sidebar menu items, the sidebar disappears.

Root cause likely:
- Missing /super-admin/* routes in router
- Layout/sidebar mounted only on certain routes; when route mismatches, app falls into 404 layout and sidebar unmounts
- Sidebar links pointing to non-existent paths

Goal:
- Ensure Super Admin always lands on a valid route
- Register all /super-admin/* routes
- Ensure SuperAdminLayout stays mounted for all /super-admin/* paths so sidebar never disappears
- Ensure sidebar menu items link to existing routes

Implementation steps:

1) Router: Add a dedicated SuperAdminLayout wrapper
- Create a route group for /super-admin/*
- For ANY path starting with /super-admin, render SuperAdminLayout which includes:
  - Admin sidebar
  - Topbar
  - Main outlet section where the page component renders

2) Add/verify routes exist
Ensure these routes exist and render valid components (even basic placeholders if needed):
- /super-admin/dashboard
- /super-admin/tenants
- /super-admin/admins (or platform-admins, but sidebar must match)
- /super-admin/billing
- /super-admin/audit-logs
- /super-admin/security
- /super-admin/system-settings
- /super-admin/regions

If any pages do not exist yet, create minimal pages with correct headings (no 404).

3) Fix post-login redirect
- After admin-login success for PLATFORM_SUPER_ADMIN, redirect to /super-admin/dashboard (only if it exists)
- If dashboard route is not used, redirect to the actual first valid page (e.g., /super-admin/tenants)

4) Fix sidebar links + disappearing menu
- Sidebar should not depend on “current route match to show”
- Sidebar visibility should depend only on admin session + role, not on route validity
- Ensure all sidebar links use the router Link component (Wouter Link), not <a href>, to avoid full reloads

5) 404 handling
- For /super-admin/* unknown paths, show a SuperAdmin 404 page INSIDE the SuperAdminLayout (sidebar stays visible)
- Do not fall back to public 404 page for /super-admin/*

6) Tests / verification
- Login as Super Admin -> lands on /super-admin/dashboard without 404
- Click each sidebar item -> navigates without sidebar disappearing
- Unknown /super-admin/xyz -> shows admin 404 but sidebar remains

Deliverables:
- List of routes added/updated
- Confirmed redirect target after login
- Confirmed sidebar no longer disappears
