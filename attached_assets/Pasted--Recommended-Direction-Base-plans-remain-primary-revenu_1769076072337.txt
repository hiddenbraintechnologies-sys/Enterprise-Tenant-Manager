✅ Recommended Direction
Base plans remain primary revenue, add-ons become the growth multiplier

Not “add-ons only”
Not “plans only”
But a 90/10 → 70/30 progression over time

This is the safest + most profitable path for your platform.

Why this is the right choice for your SaaS
1️⃣ Your customers are SMBs (India & Malaysia)

SMBs:

Decide fast on simple plans

Get confused by complex pricing

Hate “nickel-and-dime” pricing early

So:

Plans must remain the anchor

Add-ons should feel optional, not mandatory

👉 If add-ons dominate too early, conversion drops.

2️⃣ Your plans are already priced perfectly

You nailed this:

Plan	Price	Purpose
Free	₹0	Trial / lead-gen
Basic	₹99	Mass adoption
Pro	₹199	Serious businesses

This pricing wins on trust.

If you suddenly push too many paid add-ons, users will feel:

“₹99 plan is fake — real cost is much higher”

That kills word-of-mouth.

3️⃣ Add-ons should monetize growth moments

Add-ons work best when:

Business grows

Compliance kicks in

Scale pain appears

Examples:

Payroll when employee count > 10

HRMS when attendance becomes messy

WhatsApp when collections become manual

👉 That means add-ons should convert later, not at signup.

The Strategy I Recommend (Very Clear)
Phase 1 (Now → 6 months)

Plans = primary revenue (≈80–90%)

Push Basic ₹99 and Pro ₹199

Keep most users on plans

Add-ons exist, but:

Soft upsell

Trial-first

Contextual discovery only

Add-ons revenue goal: 10–20%

Phase 2 (After traction)

Balanced revenue (≈70% plans / 30% add-ons)

Introduce:

Payroll

Advanced HRMS

Compliance packs

Add bundles:

Pro + Payroll discount

Add usage-based add-ons

Now add-ons become meaningful.

Phase 3 (Mature SaaS)

Add-ons become growth engine

Enterprise tenants

Country compliance packs

API access

Advanced analytics

Multi-branch / reseller add-ons

At this stage, add-ons may exceed plans — but only then.

What this means for NEXT development (very concrete)

Because you chose Plans primary, next focus should be:

✅ 1. Improve Plan Conversion UX

Better Free → Basic nudges

Clear “Why upgrade” copy

Feature comparison clarity

✅ 2. Keep Add-ons Discoverable, Not Aggressive

Show add-ons only when relevant

Locked module screens explain value

Trial-first, no hard paywalls

✅ 3. Bundle Carefully (Not Too Early)

Only bundle:

Pro + HRMS

Pro + Payroll

Never bundle with Free/Basic yet

❌ What NOT to do now

❌ Force add-ons for core workflows

❌ Hide essential features behind add-ons

❌ Push add-ons on Day 1 signup

Final Answer (the one you can align the team around)

Base plans remain the primary revenue source.
Add-ons are a strategic upsell layer that monetizes growth, compliance, and scale — not entry.

This matches:

Your pricing

Your markets

Your architecture
