Add a downgrade confirmation UX that shows what features/limits the tenant will lose when switching from current plan to the pending downgrade plan at period-end.

We already have:
- FEATURE_CATALOG (feature key, label, description)
- LIMIT_CATALOG (users, customers, records, etc.)
- Plans include featureFlags json + limits json
- /packages page is API-driven

GOAL:
When tenant admin schedules or changes a downgrade plan:
Show a modal that clearly lists:
1) Features that will be LOST (enabled now, disabled after downgrade)
2) Limits that will get tighter (e.g. users 10 -> 3, records unlimited -> 500)
3) Effective date: currentPeriodEnd
Require confirmation before scheduling/changing downgrade.

------------------------------------------------
Frontend implementation
------------------------------------------------
1) Create helper functions:
- getLostFeatures(currentPlan, targetPlan):
  returns FEATURE_CATALOG items where:
  currentPlan.featureFlags[key] === true AND targetPlan.featureFlags[key] !== true

- getReducedLimits(currentPlan, targetPlan):
  For each key in LIMIT_CATALOG:
   - interpret -1 as Unlimited
   - if current is Unlimited and target is finite => reduced
   - if both finite and target < current => reduced
   return list with: { key, label, from, to }

2) Add DowngradeConfirmModal component:
Props:
- currentPlan
- targetPlan
- effectiveAt (date)
- onConfirm()
- onCancel()

Modal sections:
A) Title: “Confirm downgrade”
B) Subtitle: “Downgrade will take effect on <effectiveAt>. You keep current features until then.”
C) Lost features list:
   - show label + short description
   - if none: show “No feature removals”
D) Reduced limits list:
   - “Users: 10 → 3”
   - “Records: Unlimited → 500”
   - “Customers: 200 → 25”
   - if none: “No limit reductions”
E) Buttons:
   - Cancel
   - Confirm downgrade

3) Wire it into /packages:
- When user clicks “Downgrade” or “Switch downgrade to this plan”
  - open modal
  - onConfirm -> call POST /api/billing/subscription/change action="downgrade"

4) Improve banner:
- If status="downgrading":
  “Downgrade scheduled on <date> to <planName>”
  Add links/buttons:
  - Change plan
  - Cancel downgrade

------------------------------------------------
Backend (no big changes required)
------------------------------------------------
5) No backend changes required, but ensure subscription endpoint returns currentPeriodEnd.

------------------------------------------------
Tests
------------------------------------------------
6) Add UI unit tests for helper logic:
- Lost features computed correctly
- Reduced limits computed correctly including Unlimited (-1)

Acceptance:
- Tenant admin sees exactly what they will lose before confirming downgrade
- Unlimited -> finite limit is shown clearly
- Feature removals derived from FEATURE_CATALOG
- Works both for initial downgrade scheduling and changing pending downgrade plan
