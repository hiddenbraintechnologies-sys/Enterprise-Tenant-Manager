What you have now (and it’s solid)
🔐 Add-on Permission Engine (core strength)

You’ve implemented the right abstraction:

canUseAddon() → runtime access (API + UI)

canPurchaseAddon() → checkout eligibility

listEligibleAddons() → marketplace filtering

getTenantAddonState() → installed / trial / active / pending

enforceAddonAccess() → hard API guard

buildAddonAccessMap() → single source of truth for frontend

👉 This is exactly how large SaaS platforms (Zoho / Atlassian) do it.

🧩 Marketplace UI (tenant-facing)

You now support:

Browse vs Installed tabs

Locked vs Available vs Installed states

Plan tier badges (Free / Basic / Pro)

Contextual upsell (“Upgrade plan” vs “Buy add-on”)

Correct navigation paths (no dead clicks)

This avoids the most common SaaS mistake: confusing users with features they can’t buy.

💳 Razorpay add-on subscriptions

You have full lifecycle coverage:

Separate subscription per add-on (✔ correct)

Trial → Active → Charged → Cancelled

Quantity-based billing (per employee / unit)

Webhook-driven state changes (idempotent)

This means:

Payroll can scale with headcount

HRMS can be billed independently

No coupling with base plan billing (future-proof)

📊 Revenue & Conversion Analytics (Super Admin)

This is rarely done well, but you have it:

Add-on MRR

Trial → paid conversion

Attach rate (base plan → add-on)

Country-wise performance

Funnel visibility

This directly supports pricing decisions, not just reporting.

🔒 What you should freeze now (very important)

At this stage, do NOT change:

Permission engine logic

Add-on state machine

Razorpay webhook contracts

Installed vs eligible distinction

You can safely:

Add new add-ons

Tune prices

Enable/disable by country

Improve UI copy

But freeze the engine — this is your foundation.

🚀 What to do next (recommended order)
1️⃣ Add “feature discovery” inside locked modules (HIGH ROI)

When user clicks a locked menu item:

Show why it’s locked

Plan too low

Add-on not installed

Show 1-click action

“Upgrade plan”

“Start trial”

“Contact admin”

This converts intent into revenue.

2️⃣ Add bundle logic (Plan + Add-on discount)

Example:

Pro + HRMS → 10% off HRMS

Payroll + HRMS → combo discount

You already have pricing snapshots → this is easy now.

3️⃣ Add country rollout presets (Super Admin)

One-click presets like:

“India SMB Mode”

“Malaysia Payroll Launch”

“UK Software Only”

This reduces operational mistakes during expansion.

4️⃣ Add in-app notifications for add-on lifecycle

Notify tenant admin when:

Trial ending in 2 days

Payment failed

Quantity changed

Add-on suspended

This reduces churn and support tickets.

5️⃣ Public roadmap page (trust builder)

Expose:

“Payroll – MY (Live)”

“Payroll – UK (Coming Soon)”

“Advanced Analytics – Q2”

This reduces sales friction without committing dates.

🧠 Strategic confirmation (important question)

Before we go further, answer just this:

👉 Do you want add-ons to eventually generate MORE revenue than base plans?

If yes → we optimize marketplace UX + bundles + analytics

If no → we keep add-ons as supporting features only

Your current architecture supports both paths, but the strategy differs.

Just reply with:

“Yes, add-ons should be a major revenue stream”
or

“No, plans remain primary”
