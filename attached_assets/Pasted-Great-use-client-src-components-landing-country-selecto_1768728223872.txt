Great — use client/src/components/landing/country-selector.tsx as the source of truth for the landing modal, and make it API-driven using /api/public/rollouts so MY/UK become selectable when isActive=true.

Below is an exact patch you can paste to Replit (it tells Replit exactly what to change), plus the expected behavior.

✅ Replit Prompt (targeted to your file)
Update landing country selector modal to be API-driven (no hardcoded coming soon).

Files:
- client/src/components/landing/country-selector.tsx (main modal)
- client/src/components/landing/coming-soon.tsx (reuse)
- (optional) client/src/components/country-selector.tsx if it shares logic

Backend already has /api/public/rollouts returning:
[{ countryCode, isActive, comingSoonMessage, enabledBusinessTypes }]

Implement:

1) In client/src/components/landing/country-selector.tsx:
- Fetch /api/public/rollouts on mount using TanStack Query.
- Build a map: rolloutByCode[countryCode] = {isActive, comingSoonMessage}
- Render country buttons from a COUNTRY_OPTIONS array (IN, MY, UK, AE, SG) but mark each as:
  - enabled if rolloutByCode[code]?.isActive === true
  - disabled if missing rollout row OR isActive === false

2) UX:
- If disabled: show a small "Coming soon" pill below the country name.
- Clicking disabled country should NOT set selection; instead open ComingSoon component using message from rollout (fallback: "Coming soon").
- Clicking enabled country sets selection and closes modal.

3) Persist selection:
- Keep existing storage key app:country (or whatever you use currently).
- Keep app:lang untouched.

4) Ensure:
- MY and UK become selectable immediately when rollout config isActive=true
- If a rollout record is missing, the country defaults to coming soon.

Acceptance:
- Landing page modal shows IN/MY/UK and status.
- MY/UK are clickable when rollout says active.
- Coming soon message uses rollout.comingSoonMessage.

Return: short summary + which files changed.

✅ Implementation details (what the code should do)
Data source (single truth)

GET /api/public/rollouts → gives:

countryCode

isActive

comingSoonMessage

Country UI behavior
Country rollout	UI shows	Click result
isActive=true	normal button	selects country
isActive=false	disabled + “Coming soon”	shows coming soon message
no record	treated as coming soon	shows generic coming soon
🔥 Common mistake to avoid

Do not keep hardcoded “coming soon” logic in the modal.
The modal must always defer to /api/public/rollouts.

After this change, how you verify quickly

Go to landing /

Open country modal

Confirm MY + UK are clickable (if super admin set active)

Select Malaysia → register → business dropdown should match MY rollout

Select UK → same
