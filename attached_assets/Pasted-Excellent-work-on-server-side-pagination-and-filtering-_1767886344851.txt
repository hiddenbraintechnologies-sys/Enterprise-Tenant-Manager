Excellent work on server-side pagination and filtering. Now proceed with the following production-grade improvements and validations.

1️⃣ Automated Integration & Regression Tests
- Add end-to-end tests for all Furniture module pages:
  • Products, Raw Materials, BOM
  • Production Orders, Sales Orders
  • Deliveries & Installations
- Test cases must cover:
  • Pagination navigation (next, previous, first, last)
  • Server-side filters (search, status, category, lowStock, order type)
  • Multi-tenant isolation (users cannot see other tenants' data)
  • RBAC enforcement (staff vs admin vs super-admin)
  • Financial validation for sales orders and payments
  • Read-only enforcement for final statuses
- Prefer Playwright or Cypress for frontend, Jest + Supertest for API endpoints

2️⃣ Flutter Mobile App Sync
- Ensure all paginated endpoints reflect **same server-side filters** in mobile app
- Implement:
  • Infinite scroll or paginated fetch matching web dashboard
  • Filter parameters (search, status, category, lowStock) passed in API requests
  • Proper loading & empty states
- Test mobile behavior against same demo tenant data

3️⃣ Performance Validation
- Validate high-volume scenarios:
  • 1000+ products/raw materials
  • 500+ production & sales orders
  • Concurrent deliveries & installations updates
- Ensure response times < 300ms for list endpoints
- Verify indexes, query optimization, and no N+1 issues

4️⃣ Optional Enhancements
- Add debounced search delay parameter configurable in frontend (default 300ms)
- Add server-side sorting support if missing (createdAt, name, sku, status, priority)
- Ensure filtered counts and “Showing X–Y of Z (filtered)” displays correctly

5️⃣ Completion Criteria
- All tests pass
- Mobile app fetches and displays data consistently with web dashboard
- Pagination, filtering, sorting are robust, performant, and multi-tenant safe
- Furniture module is fully production-ready

OUTPUT EXPECTED:
- Automated test suite covering all scenarios
- Flutter mobile pagination & filtering working
- Confirmation report: all endpoints performant, filters consistent, no regressions
