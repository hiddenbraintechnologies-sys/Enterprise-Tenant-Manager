What “Zoho-style Settings” actually means

Zoho does NOT use:

Overview cards

Tile dashboards

Big navigation hubs

Zoho DOES use:

A left vertical settings navigation

A right-side content panel

Forms inline, not hidden behind cards

One page = one logical settings group

Minimal animations, very dense but clear

So your current design changed because you moved toward a hub pattern.
To be Zoho-like, you must undo the hub, not refine it.

Zoho-style structure (exact)
/settings

Single page layout:

---------------------------------------------------
| Settings |                                      |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Profile  |  Profile form                         |
| Business |  Business settings form               |
| Branding |  Branding form                         |
| Billing  |  Billing info                          |
| Security |  Security settings                     |
|----------|--------------------------------------|


No cards.
No overview tiles.
Just left nav + right content.

What you should change (very specific)
1️⃣ REMOVE the Settings Overview cards ❌

These must go:

Profile card

Business card

Branding card

Billing card tiles

Zoho never uses these.

2️⃣ Left sidebar = primary navigation (keep this ✅)

Your left sidebar is already good:

Overview (optional – can remove)
Profile
Business
Branding
Appearance
Notifications
Billing
Security


👉 Clicking an item renders content on the right, not navigates to a hub.

3️⃣ Right panel = inline forms (Zoho-style)
Example: Business (Zoho-like)

Title: Business
Subtitle: Configure your business settings

Section 1: Business Profile

Business name

Business type (readonly)

Section 2: Regional Settings

Time zone

Currency

Save button at bottom-right (sticky optional)

No cards inside cards.
No preview widgets here.

Example: Branding (Zoho-like)

Title: Branding
Subtitle: Customize your company identity

Section 1: Logo & Favicon

Upload logo

Upload favicon

Section 2: Brand Colors

Primary

Secondary

Accent

Section 3: Preview (optional)

Small inline preview (not a big card)

This matches Zoho Books / Zoho CRM exactly.

4️⃣ Appearance = ONE option only

Zoho rule:

Appearance = theme only

So:

Theme dropdown

That’s it
No branding here.

5️⃣ Remove “Overview” entirely (recommended)

Zoho usually doesn’t have a Settings Overview.

If you keep it:

Make it read-only summary

No tiles

No actions

But best:
❌ Remove Overview

Tailwind layout for Zoho-style Settings (copy this)
Page layout
<div className="flex h-full">
  {/* Left Settings Nav */}
  <aside className="w-64 border-r bg-background">
    <SettingsNav />
  </aside>

  {/* Right Content */}
  <main className="flex-1 px-6 py-6 max-w-4xl">
    <SettingsContent />
  </main>
</div>

Section spacing
<div className="space-y-6">
  <header>
    <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold">Business</h1>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      Configure your business settings
    </p>
  </header>

  <div className="space-y-4">
    {/* form fields */}
  </div>

  <div className="flex justify-end pt-4">
    <Button>Save</Button>
  </div>
</div>


This is very Zoho-like.

Key differences vs what you have now
Feature	Current	Zoho-style
Overview cards	✅ Present	❌ Remove
Navigation	Sidebar + cards	Sidebar only
Forms	Hidden behind tiles	Inline
Density	Spacious	Compact
Scroll	Many pages	One per section
UX goal	Discoverability	Efficiency

Zoho optimizes for power users, not exploration.

Final recommendation (clear)

If your goal is Zoho-like:

✅ Keep left settings sidebar
❌ Remove settings overview cards
✅ Render forms directly on the right
✅ Group fields tightly
✅ Save button always visible
❌ No tile dashboards inside settings

Your current screen is NOT wrong,
but it’s Stripe-style, not Zoho-style.
