Phase 2 Subscription & Pricing Control Implementation

Project: MyBizStream — Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform (Web + Flutter Mobile)
Goal: Implement and verify subscription & pricing control across modules, tiers, and countries with platform-owner management.

Instructions to AI/Automation:

Backend Implementation

Build subscription middleware enforcing access per tenant subscription.

Implement APIs for:

Create/manage subscription packages (globalPricingPlans)

Set country-specific pricing (countryPricingConfigs + planLocalPrices)

Assign subscriptions to tenants (tenantSubscriptions)

Track invoices/payments (subscriptionInvoices)

Ensure tier-based module access (✅ included, 💰 add-on, ❌ unavailable).

Integrate premium feature gating for Enterprise-only modules (Multi-Currency, AI Insights, White-Label).

Apply tax rates and country-specific payment gateways per tenant location.

Update Maturity Score computation to include subscription support (+15%).

Flutter Mobile App

Add guard BLoC/middleware to enforce module access per tenant subscription.

Ensure tier-based features display correctly: hide unavailable modules, show add-on options, mark Enterprise-only features.

Show country-specific pricing in subscription selection screens.

Admin / Platform Owner UI

Enable creation and editing of subscription plans.

Configure per-country pricing, tax rates, and exchange rates.

Assign tenants to subscription tiers and monitor usage limits (max users, modules).

Audit & Verification

Test module access enforcement for all tiers.

Verify country-specific prices and tax handling are applied correctly.

Confirm notifications for subscription changes and invoices are sent via all channels (Email, WhatsApp, In-App).

Check analytics adapters report subscription usage metrics correctly.

Output

Table: Tenant × Module × Subscription Access × Country Pricing × Premium Features
